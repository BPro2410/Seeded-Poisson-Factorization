Before this I had the same product for another two years (which my mom now has and uses daily). It is a very dependable and sturdy straightener. I have long curly hair and my hair always comes out straight and silky after use. I have had previous straighters that costed more than $200 and they didn't do any justice. One of the best reasons I think this one lasts the longest is because the wire that comes out swivels. Many straighteners do not last long bc the wire gets bent and comes loose when you bend it. Since this one swivels the wire never has to bend. If you are looking for a cheaper great product, this is it!",beauty,hair care,styling tools,128
35237,B000NW884A,Zoya Nail Polish,A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,3/3,4.0,1326585600,"Found this at Ulta after considering an online purchase of Zoya (after reading reviews). Gemma is an army green color, and in the bottle, you can see the contrast dichroic-type effect of pale purple shimmer. However, once it's on the nails, that dichro effect is lost. It simply looks like a shiny army green. I think that the difference between regular ambient light in a room (or outdoors) and the pale purple shimmer is simply not great enough to show a difference. If you're looking for army green, go for it. If you're looking for dichroic effect, keep looking.On the plus side, I did my nails last night and have spent about 10 hours typing since then, and they show no wear at all. Right now I'm using OPI's Natural Nail Base Coat and Top Coat, but I have the Zoya products on order (Ulta didn't stock those). I'm hoping the all-Zoya combo will give me a super long wear. I'll come back and report in when this one starts to show wear, and also after my first all-Zoya manicure begins to show wear. So far, I recommend!Edit. Zoya took a really long time to ship out my stuff. My Gemma manicure lasted 10 days with only minimal edge wear (which only I could see; people talking to me couldn't tell). I was bored with the color, so I went to Ulta and bought ""Sarah"" (a metallic red) and did that with Orly's ""Top 2 Bottom"" base/top coat. So far this has lasted 5 days and is not showing wear.Of course the Zoya stuff showed up the next day. So I stripped the ""Sarah"" manicure off my right hand and used the Zoya Anchor base coat, 2 coats of Sarah, and the Armor top coat. This has lasted 4 days so far (no wear). I'm really impressed with the longevity of this nail polish. I used to be an all-OPI girl, but when their stuff started chipping within a day I decided it was time to look elsewhere. Zoya is now my top stop for new nail polishes. Just wish they'd either ship faster, or that Ulta would stock 100% of their products!",beauty,makeup,nails,363

I had the whole Montecito set since my son was born, so when he turned 1 I had to get this. I still love it to this day. It was sooooooo easy to install.

I only use the top latch if I have that problem. The cup holders are sooo convenient. If you feel that the straps are getting too tight or the bottom buckle is too short even after adjusting the straps, you have to move them to a higher position. There are 3 positions for the straps and 3 for the buckle. My child is 3 and is tall and I am just about to move to the 3rd one actually.

8449,B000FPIM9G,Telemergency Pro-Elite 700E with Wireless Help Pendant,A1UAZ6MNSZKB7G,72/76,2.0,1169942400,"I care for an elderly parent in home, and needed something to alert me in case they fell or needed assistance while in another part of the house. I had hoped this device would be the solution. My plan was to program it to call my cell phone if my parent ever pressed the pendant alert button.There were a number of problems from the start. First, the unit was difficult to program. It took several steps -- switching power on and off, speakers on and off, and so forth -- and it balked when I tried to enter the forwarding number. The touch tones just wouldn't register in the base unit. It took several attempts to get the number entered.Second there were two buttons on the pendant -- one for alert, one to cancel the alert. I would prefer only one button on an alert pendant, so the feeble or elderly won't be needlessly confused or accidentally press the wrong button and think help is coming when it isn't, or accidentally cancel a help call before it is made.Third the pendant range was very short. It wasn't comforting to think the person wearing it could easily get out of range and the alert button be useless. I found it only worked reliably when the pendant was in the same room as the base unit.Fourth is the ""off hook"" behavior of the system. It would be easier if the unit would simply pick up and play a few beeps and the alert message over the phone if someone happens to be using the extension. Instead, the unit tries to make the calls anyway. You get alerted, yes, with a bunch of attempted calls and touch tone sounds, but I think it could have been done better.I just didn't find it trustworthy enough to use. I sent it back, and opted instead for a low-tech (and much cheaper) simple pendant alarm that's activated by a pull on a string. The only downside to it -- which is true of the Telemergency 700C too -- is that it isn't waterproof and can't be worn or used in the shower. But that's what we're going with until someone comes up with a more reliable and trustworthy and well thought out product.Update",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,daily living aids,377

I wish the indicators were included up to size 5!I like pampers better than all of the other brands we were given at my baby shower (up & up, huggies, kirkland) because the material is cloth-like instead of plastic-like and there is a mesh fabric over the actual pad which helps elevate her butt off of that watery/mushy newborn poop.She isn't a super chunky baby, with up & up she would always explode out of the back of the diaper, with kirkland and huggies (same company) she would always explode out of the legs of her diaper, but pampers keeps it all in.",baby products,diapering,disposable diapers,168

Now while I did think that there were some minor faults with the model of the Jenga Fett action figure I bought those faults were nothing compared to the clone troopers. Personally I was let down a bit with the body proportions of the action figure. I found the proportion of the helmet to be slightly bigger and obvious to the human eye. I thought this was strange looking. Flexibility wise, I didn't have problems with that although I wished that I was able to bend the arms at the elbow joints. The body of the figure itself is rather skinny. I thought it would have the similiar mass size of Jenga Fett. What really annoyed me was that the rifle that came with the figure didn't hold well in the hands of the figure. Either the hands or the rifle could have been designed better. I did like the missile launcher. That I didn't have a problem with. Call me picky but this design of the clone trooper could have been better.

Having purchased other Melissa and Doug products over the years with great satisfaction, we assumed that this was another one of their wonderful toys. While the armoire is cute, there are two problems with it:1. It is touted as being sized correctly for 18"" dolls; however, the hanging part of the armoire is too short for most of their clothes. In addition, the hanging section is divided into two narrow areas, each of which is really too skinny to hold more than just a few items of clothing.2. The paint finish does not hold up well to even the most minor usage. When carefully unwrapping the armoire from the packaging, we actually chipped a couple of small areas. Since this item is meant for children to play with, the paint should hold up better than that.Since we have always been happy with Doug and Melissa toys, we assumed that we would be happy with this armoire and didn't conduct our research on it as thoroughly as we would have otherwise.

The display gives all the information I need to know the status of each cell (4 completely independent and programmable channels) and it lets me fully control the charging process. This is of great value to me.The charger reports the actual capacity of each cell based on the current delivered during the discharge cycle in the programs that do discharging, so you know after the cycle is complete what the capacity of each cell is, and you can use that to match the cells for use in groups; and also to determine which cells need more cycling to return their capacity.Great charger, I am so glad I bought this baby.",health personal care,household supplies,unknown,175

22730,B000ATV8ZM,Commit Lozenges,A3U4FCEAT75XLS,2/2,4.0,1270512000,"Commit Lozenges are very addictive. As long as you understand that and deal with it maturely, they can really get the job done of quitting smoking. I am celebrating my one-year anniversary of sucking on my last lozenge by writing this review. Yes, it can be done! However, it took me three YEARS to quit the lozenges.The lozenges are much, much, much more effective than the gum or patches. There is really no comparison. In the first week or two, the lozenges kill about 80 % of the urge to smoke, and then after a few weeks, 100 %. It gets to a point where you'd much prefer the lozenge to a cigarette, because the lozenges have most or possibly all of the satisfaction of smoking a cigarette, with none of the outward side-effects such as smell, social stigma, etc. In fact, once you have a big pile of lozenges laying around, there is no real reason or desire to smoke cigarettes. They provide a nice, even, satisfying nicotine feed that is far superior to the extreme ups and downs of smoking a cig and then not getting to smoke another one for a while.And therein lies the challenge, because the lozenges are so satisfying to the nicotine craving that they are very addicting. They are as addicting as cigarettes, in the same sense that you want one as soon as you finish the last one. I found myself taking a break from lozenges by having an occasional cigarette. That's how twisted it gets - you end up smoking to try to break the habit of taking the lozenges. Think of the lozenges as extremely expensive cigarettes that will just give you mouth cancer instead of lung cancer.At some point, of course, you just have to make the decision to get it over with once and for all, and STOP. It will be hard. It's probably easier to do it with the lozenges than cigarettes, but it's not a cakewalk. You have to want it. Really want it. Standing in your way is the fact that it is a lot easier to pop another lozenge than to change your life. But the upside of lozenges is, I think, that while it takes months for your brain to adjust to life without cigarettes, I think the brain can kick the lozenge habit in 3-4 days, with another 4-8 weeks of general nicotine longing that is not quite as intense but is still uncomfortable and challenging. Be prepared for a a couple of uncomfortable, challenging months. It is insanely difficult to not have anything in your mouth, after however many years you were used to having cigarettes and then the lozenges. I highly recommend Altoid mints to transition from the lozenges to, eventually, nothing. Altoids are so strong they almost burn your mouth, thus masking the weird longing for nicotine that you feel in your mouth for a few months. Nothing else has that strength to fully mask the nicotine craving.",health personal care,health care,smoking cessation,499

16037,B0000DBN2C,"Prilosec OTC Acid Reducer, Delayed-Release Tablets",A1OMZVCZVTNH5N,1/1,5.0,1227398400,"Prilosec is the oldest of the Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) on the market. So, it has a loooooong history, and to my knowledge a safe history. As for me, I take comfort in a drug that has a long safe history, and that is why I like Prilosec. Also, for me, the side effects occurred in the first few days, but then wore off. I still have minor gas problems, but there may be an anti-gas OTC drug available for that, I don't know yet. One thing I learned is that it is helpful to know the differences between an Antacid (e..g. Tums, Rolaids, etc.), a PPI (e.g. Prilosec, the actual drug name being ""omeprazolel"") and an H2 blocker (e.g. Pepcid, the actual drug name being ""famotidine""). All three work differently from each other and have different side effects. A pharmacist or your doctor should be able to tell you the differences. All I know is that an antacid is simply a huge dose of calcium carbonate that works immediately to reduce the acid already in the stomach. That is why you feel immediate relief, albeit one which lasts only one or two hours; and come 4 am you feel the bottom of your esophagus on fire again. PPIs and H2 blockers instead go through your bloodstream and eventually (that is why it takes much more time than an antacid) alter the acid producing mechanisms (pumps?) in your stomach. I have Barrett's Esophagus (loosely defined as a more advanced condition of GERD), and my understanding is that PPIs are better for this condition. The point is, if you know more about your condition and the differences between Antacids, PPIs and H2 blockers, you will save yourself an immense amount of trouble and time. For example, if you find a PPI such as Prilosec ain't working for you, then it will probably be the case that other PPIs are not going to work for you either, since their base chemical formulation works in a similar way. Ergo, switch to an H2 blocker and see what happens. If both PPIs and H2 blockers give you unbearable side effects, then you probably have to go through the entire laundry list of PPIs and H2 blockers out there.

I've been using the Attends products for more than twenty years now and they have hit an all-new low as far as I'm concerned. These briefs (diapers) used to be the pinnacle when it came to adult briefs and now they are worse than depend or any other store band for that mater.I can remember back in the late 80's through the early 2000's when you could go to the store and pickup a bag of these for less than 20 bucks and it would only take two per day for moderate to severe incontinent. When Paperback purchased the product line from P&G; they continued to make the same product for a year or so and then they started making changes.The product is now very poorly made out of a cheap and very loud plastic backing and very thin, not nearly as absorbent as it wants was when made by P&G.; When wet, the cotton material clumps and falls down between your legs and collects there until you change. This is all after the first wetting.The tapes do hold good but you're unable to remove them without ripping the outer plastic. So once your have them on you have them on. If you are able to make it to the restroom, you will need to replace the garment with a new one because you have ripped the outer plastic and have rendered it useless.The absorbency is good for about one to two wettings depending on the amount. If it were a gusher, I would replace it just as soon as I can. Also you will get the smell that go's along with a wet undergarment. There is no hiding the fact that you have yet yourself.Now for the worst part, the leg gathers on each side of the brief will continue to chafe until it causes a sore. So you will need to find another product to change back and forth so that it will not get so irritating that you cannot stand to have the briefs on at all.",health personal care,health care,incontinence,343

The fold-up concept is great, but as the baby moves the water in the tub sloshes around, seeps out of the hinged areas of the tub, and gets all over your counter. In order to prevent this problem, you have to put so little water in the tub, your baby will hardly get wet. Also, the pad on mine came unstuck. I called the company and they replaced it but the same thing happened that time. I would think twice before purchasing this tub.

I started with the wooden Eddie Bauer because I liked the way it looked and it matched my decor. I returned it because it didn't recline, the height wasn't adjustable, it was hard and seemed uncomfortable, and it had no wheels. Plus, it didn't fold for storage. Next, I purchased the Evenflo Discovery High Chair. I loved most of the features (it reclined, the height was adjustable, it was a little more comfortable than the Eddie Bauer, it had wheels, and it folded for storage) except the seat was too deep and my child who is in the 95th percentile for height could barely see over the top. The activity center was way too loud and the graphics could not be seen by the baby. On that note they couldn't really be seen in a normally lit kitchen by anyone. The seat would never sit all the way up and I had to prop a pillow behind my baby at every mealtime which was ridiculous. When I returned it I was told there was no defect that is just how the chair is made. I doesn't keep your baby straight up. Finally, I brought my child to the store and sat him in the high chairs I was considering (below $100). I was so happy with the Baby Trend Palm Tree High Chair. It had ALL OF THE FEATURES I was looking for and it was super comfortable. Plus, it had shoulder straps, which when worn loosely added extra safety without restricting movement.

All players then write down their honest answers, and the person whose turn it is earns points as they make correct matches between players and their answers.If you think about it for a minute you'll see how this game can work well for people that know each other well, as well as for people that have just met.One thing that we learned the hard way about this game is that it can REALLY drag if you try to play it with too many players. We tried to play it with as many as 12 players at a family reunion, and that was a mistake! It took forever to play, since it was so long between a player's turns. If, on the other hand, you play with fewer than 8 players the game moves along quite nicely.The game rules suggest that this is a game best suited for teens and up, but we found that if you are willing to pick and choose questions even younger players can join in.

The Event Cards were a great option.The cards are drawn from their deck in place of rolling a dice. Regular Catan gameplay is followed otherwise. Several cards have basic gameplay instructions (harvest crops, activate robber, etc.) while adding in new gameplay elements like Earthquakes, Good Neighbors, and Epidemics, among others. The Earthquake for example might damage an existing road, and no new roads can be created until the road is repaired. Another card might call for the player with the largest current army to give production cards to all other players. Or the player with the most ports might get their choice of a free production card.I wouldn't say gameplay is radically different by using the Event Cards, but the little tweaks are fun. When used with the 'Cities & Knights' expansion, several additional changes are listed on the cards. I have not tried this with the C&E; expansion, but it looks to effect gameplay even more than in a traditional game.My only knock is that the 'roll of the dice' are much more predictable. There are x amount 9's, 12's, etc. So the randomness of the dice is completely absent. If you're sitting on a 3 and an 11, you're pretty well stuck for the duration of the game. On the upside, they'll definitely come up at least once, but not over and over as the dice might provide. It leads to a somewhat stagnant feeling if you have weak placement.Overall, it's a nice little addition to change up the game for familiar players, and at an affordable price, but is lacking the excitement the regular dice provide.",toys games,games,board games,290

Now she is 3-months-old and this was the very first activity toy she activated all by herself! She loved the Cookie Monster voice the best and kept sounding it off over & over. The concept of ""activity"" toys is that the parents have to be involved in the activity.

In my daughter's case, she is an infant so right now she is only intrigued with lights, sounds, and smells, mostly.

The way they close is annoying because it doesn't freeze flat at all and I can only store 3 bags of milk per container- thus taking up tons of space in the freezer.

My husband had no problem, but it takes me a few seconds to get it loose. The second problem is my little one figured out how to pull the tray insert up towards her. It doesn't go very far up due to the way it snaps in, but she did enjoy banging it around. Overall, it works really well and is quite handy.

Back in the 60's I just didn't feel an electric shaved as close as a blade and back then they all required cords and a hassle to clean. For two reason's I just now considered using an electric razor. I have disabilities I can't shower every day and soaking my face with a hot wash cloth to soften my beard with water dripping everywhere it became a chore. Reason number two is razor blade "" sticker shock!"" The price of blades has sky rocketed over the years. Sure blades are better then they use to be but not in proportion to the cost.I'm retired and have a lot of time to do research so I started looking for the best electric razor I could find. I read every review for all the major razor manufactures at Amazon and other web sites. I came to the conclusion that the Braun model 8995-360 stood out above the rest. The price is high, more than I really wanted to pay. Considering how easy this razor is to maintain I decided to purchase one from Amazon and as usual Amazon shipped it very fast with standard shipping.This Braun razor has exceeded my expectations. Trust me on this one folks I am delighted with the performance of this razor. For me it shaves as close as a hi tech blade. I can happily report that I have experienced no irritation I am really surprised I thought it would take a while for my face to adjust. The razor is ecologically perfect in my hand medium sized hand. The on/off switch also controls locking of the head and side burn trimmer. I have always had a problem shaving my upper lip I have a mold required me to be so careful shaving it with a blade. No problem at all with the Braun I lock the head of the razor and shave it in a flash. I am using Williams Electric Pre Shave before shaving. It seems to make the razor glide over my skin a little better and again I am getting a really close shave.I won't go into the multitude of features this razor has except to say it is so easy to use. On/off switch on razor and start cleaning button on the docking station. That is really all you have to deal with. I shave every other day and clean after each use. The cleaning cartridge last for 30 cycles so the cartridge should last two months. Amazon has the best price for replacement cartridges and I don't think it's really expensive to replace them when you consider the hassle they save you cleaning and they lube the head to. I am so glad I bought this razor.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,468

However, I saw one of these bars on sale, and because I absolutely love mocha, I decided to give it a try.Taste-wise, this bar is excellent. It is rich, chocolate-y, and has a very good, distinct mocha flavor too. It was pleasantly chewy without having the overly nougat-like consistency that some protein bars have. Overall, I definitely enjoyed this bar, and from a flavor perspective, I would not hesitate to buy it again.The reason I gave this bar 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the nutritional profile. At 200 calories, it is about what you would expect from a protein bar; I was fine with that. But both the fat content (7 grams, including 3.5 grams saturated) and the sugar content (17 grams, or over 3 teaspoons) were a little on the high side to me. Some bars include fiber; this one has &lt;1 gram. It does have 15 grams of protein, which was a big plus.So, in the end, I probably will buy this bar again, but I will limit myself to using it occasionally rather than as a more regular, healthy part of my diet.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,nutrition bars drinks,225

She loves the toy so that is a big plus. I don't think she's noticed the little things that don't really work, and she loves that she can make her new wonder fairy fly.For my part it was easy enough to put together but many of the small sprite pieces are too small to really play with around this big playset. Also the attachments for the sprites on the orange flower are impossible to keep in place so don't even try. The fact that the little slide is detachable really just means that it will get lost all the time. The fairies do fly very well, but my daughter can only get her big Barbie in, she needs help with the little fairies. At least with ours the little fairies can't fly by themselves becasue they fly off at the end without a big barbie on the other side to balance them out.The fairies are cute but they can't do very much. The little sprites have very fragile wings and they can't really move, the smaller fairies and mermaids which you must buy seperatly can really only bend at the waist, but they are very cute. The wonder fairies are very pretty, but as you can tell in the box the wings are fabric so they aren't very child friendly, and don't bother to buy the extra outfits because they're impossible to get the velcro closed and even when you can they don't stay that way once your child picks them up. We don't have this problem with regular Barbie outfits so I think these are just too small.Overall the set and having to buy the dolls seperatly is pretty pricey and it's not a very well put together little playset. However if your child loves faries and Barbie they probably won't care about the little things and they'll have a ball making their dolls fly.

Then I just read a review saying it did just that to someone and conair did nothing to recall the item, help pay hospital bills and treatment, which I hate to hear. Anyway, if you're willing to risk it I'd say this seems to be an affective device. It clears out my pores and seems to them look smaller as well as some acne cyst I have due to a medical condition I have. I also pat the sweat off then add a facial mask to my opened pores. It seems to leave my skin super super soft and glowy. Like many others have said the cone is a bit too small for your full face, but putting a towl over your head to conceal the steam does help that alittle. The brush it comes with works great too and really cleans out my pores. One other thing is even with eye cream on it really really dries out my eye (and causes redness to where it looks like I'm on drugs)to the point where they feel like they're burning and it makes me wonder if it could be causing damage to them.

It breaks the water up into streams of small droplets, producing a pleasant, stimulating sensation, while using less water. Water consumption (measured with a bucket) is about 1.5 gallons/min on high and a little less than 0.75 gal/min on low.As others have noted, the showerhead makes a loud hissing, gurgling sound. I measured 80dB with my sound meter at one foot. According to the chart that came with the meter, that compares with a large orchestra. I do not find the noise objectionable, but it is loud enough to drown out most ambient sounds.Lime buildup should not be too much of a problem, as all the water comes out of one large central opening, while air enters through small peripheral openings. The internal parts are made of a Teflon-like plastic, so internal lime buildup should be minimal. The part you connect to your shower spout is brass.The only difficulty I found is that the lowest setting is not enough to keep my tankless water heater from cycling on and off, giving alternating warm and hot water. This is not a problem on higher settings, but if you have a tankless heater, be aware that it may be a problem.I am very pleased with this product, and recommend it highly.Update 7/7/12",health personal care,personal care,unknown,217

As a test, for one week I applied only the cream. I found I had to apply it multiple times to gain the benefits equal to yet not as close as straight oil. The following week, I tried mixing the oil with body lotion but found the oil thinned the mixture to a water like WD-40 consistency. My best results has been to apply the oil first, waiting five minutes then applying body lotion.The antiseptic medicinal/herbal aroma is not as strong as the oil yet noticeably present.

We purchased this carrier for the trip and it was the only ""can't live without"" item that we packed for our trip. I love that the diaper bag zips off for when we didn't need it--or so I could put the larger backpack in the overhead compartment and smaller bag under the seat on the plane. (There's also another zipper compartment in the pack itself allowing for carrying items in the backpack). When we were getting on and off the plane, I carried our 15 month old on and off the plane in the carrier--leaving my hands free for carrying bags or holding my three year old's hand.In London, we used this carrier everywhere--for walks around the neighborhood, visiting the sites and museums, on the Tube, etc (the instructions do say not to use for public transportation--but for longer trips, we'd just take our daughter out of the carrier once we got on). For the times I was without my husband, but had both girls, my older child could ride in the small umbrella stroller we brought and I could carry my younger daughter in the backpack.I'm only 5'2"" (size 2) and my daughter weighs over 20 lbs, but I have absolutely no difficulty getting the backpack on by myself with her in it. (It's best to practice with someone else at first, but the instructions provide good guidance for doing it by yourself.) My husband is 5'11"" and it fits both of us very well.Now that we're back home, I use the carrier when I'm travelling downtown with my daughter--she rides next to me on the train and when we get off, into the carrier she goes so we can walk. This way, I don't have to try to find the elevators or otherwise fuss with a stroller. Getting on and off the train is so much easier. And, the sides of the backpack cinch up with the child isn't in the carrier--so it just looks like a large backpack.",baby products,gear,backpacks carriers,386

A RV heater is fairly expensive, but the hard part is getting to it. Plus, it also requires a lot of connections to work right, the air ducts, the propane system, the 12VDC system for the electronic thermostat and fans, which is a lot of labor.Attaching these onto the vents is a no brainer -- use the including pushing tool to attach the spring onto the existing vent protector. Only reservation of mine is that if that one small spring breaks, off goes the screen. I might see about caulking the edge with Dicor or something heat-resistant as additional insurance, but so far, it has held up without any problems.Here in Texas, hornets and mud dauber wasps get almost anywhere that isn't screened, so making sure they stay out of your RV ducting is important.",toys games,games,unknown,145

I have tried other systems (strips, washes, rinses, special toothpastes) and these do the job. I have a sensitive constitution and a lot of dental work, however, I had no gum sensitivity or bleeding of any kind -- and I am finicky. The gel takes some practice to master. You need to hold the tray to you teeth and spread the gel up and down, both to distribute it evenly and have a more satisfactory result, as well as to keep it in place. I leave them on for an hour, so as to get my money's worth and there has been no discomfort whatsoever. I do not want to have blue white teeth - just a whiter version of natural enamel and this achieves it.When finished, I always brush my teeth to remove the gel - sometimes with the new foaming, whitening Aquafresh toothpaste and sometimes with food grade peroxide and baking soda, making a paste. It takes off all the residue and my teeth and gums feel clean and sterile. The flavor is pleasant, as well and there was no burning or aftertaste, whatsoever.I cannot say that some people will not experience sensitivity, but since I have not, I was surprised and pleased. Some people will not finesse the 'installation' - patience and skill are required, but it beats having a dentist or specialist do it for many times the price, and the same result.",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene,240

The safety bar across the front of the stroller becomes undone from the body of the stroller, so that when the car seat is attached it droops. Very unsafe. We contacted Graco via e-mail within three weeks of our baby's birth with this problem, and they promised a replacement part within ten business days. Three weeks later, no part, no e-mail, no phone call. We e-mailed again -- whoops, sorry, color backordered. Hello! My kid is now six weeks old and I don't have a stroller! They sent a different color (pink -- I have a boy) and promised to send the right color when they got more in. Hello! The colored part is a fabric sleeve that slips off the new one so we could put the blue one on. And thanks for making me wait ANOTHER three weeks for this replacement part that, hey, didn't fix the problem. So I called (my husband had been dealing with all this before) and they told me that I could ship them my broken stroller, then they would examine it and ship me another, which may take a month. (Did I mention my kid is now nearly four months old?) They sent me a return shipping label (how generous) but with it was a letter stating that they can replace my stroller with any model they choose. So I called again, and they said that they could offer me a refund, but that would take six weeks to process once they received my stroller, and I could go buy another stroller out of my own pocket in the meantime. Whatever. Now they've been discontinued and I can't get another that matches the carseat that my kid has practically outgrown now anyway. I want to have a matching set, or at least a compatible stroller, so that I don't have to invest in ANOTHER stroller fiasco with our next baby. But I'm about ready to chuck everything that says Graco on it right out the window. DO NOT BUY THIS STROLLER. DO NOT EXPECT PROMPT OR REALISTIC ASSISTANCE FROM GRACO. At this point, I will have the stroller situation settled at about the same time my kid starts high school.

But he has to be pretty rough to make this happen and it is still a strong hold. I am sure that he would wake up if this, though unlikely, somehow happened in his sleep because with the rails that go under the bed the guard rail, though disconnected, is still fairly strong. The bed that my son is in is longer than the regular size twin bed because it's made for college students and the length of this rail is still substantially long enough to provide safety.",baby products,safety,rails rail guards,152

We have one close by in our den so that if a dog must be penned, it doesn't have to feel isolated or punished at the same time. Do be aware that these pens are a bit of a bluff. We have toy poodles, and these pens have always been effective with them. Just over a year ago we got our latest, and he is the smallest of the crowd. Of course, he was the one who rather quickly decided that he could jump/scramble out of the pen and does so on a whim. If we are serious about keeping him in, we must place a cover (like a spare window screen) across the top.The only danger to this pen is that there is a remote possibility that if a dog is jumping against it, they might catch a foot between the bars and get into a bad position. In almost ten years of using these, that has only happened once. However, the time it happened was a bit scary. I was concerned that the little fellow might have seriously injured his foot ... he was certainly howling piteously enough! However, I held him still while my wife carefully worked his foot loose, and he was fine.We've had no problems with the finish on these pens, and the latches work as well today as when we first bought them.

My kitties were young kittns and kept each other amused by each other's antics. I really did not need toys until the last year. Now they are both over three years and are a bit more settled. The female was looking chubby and bored, so I got out the laser toy so they could play and jump. And, I personally, was a bit tired of ""Dah Bird"" which we play with two or three times a day. So, a new toy, and one I had on hand, seemed a reasonable option.Both the male and female kitty love the laser. Around and around we go, first one way and then another. It is a bit hard to adapt to after Dah Bird which operates on such a concrete skill level. Keeping the laser ON the floor and OFF the wall or OFF the cat is a challenge, but I was getting the hang of it and it was a fun time.Then the female surprised me. She figured out that the red light came from the thing in my hand, so I thought that would be OK, just keep it out of her eyes. No Go.She will no longer play for any length of time. She may chase the red light for one revolution on the floor, but then lunges for my hand to take the laser and sit on it (that is how she deals with her prey)! I have quit letting her claws hit my hand and as she lunges, I just throw the laser in the air and let her sit on it for a while. Unless she learns to fetch and return the darned thing, this game is over with her. She is just too darned smart.My loveable male kitty...well, he is head over heel, and around and round for the red light. If he figures out the source, I will just toss the whole thing.It is nice that the company sends two sets of batteries. That should keep it operating for a long time at almost no cost. But if I have such a toy again, I will have to be more clever and not let that pesky female see the origin of that red dot. Really did not see that coming. But, it is inexpensive and it is fun for some. Just watch out for the eyes and have a good time. If you have a Mensa Cat, stick with, or move up from, Dah Bird.",pet supplies,cats,toys,434

She suggested putting him onto Clemastine Fumarate (Tavist) instead of benadryl. He has done fabulously well. His allergies always start getting bad as soon as it stops freezing over night, then get even worse as plants start blooming and summer is in full swing. Well, it's July 2009, and he still hasn't needed a cortisone shot. This is a huge benefit for his future health, since cortisone has significant long-term detrimental effects. And of course it's good for his short term quality of life because he's itch free!Furthermore, finding generic Clemastine Fumarate online has saved me a bundle. If you decide to buy this product, look for a good price. Amazon has the best price I can find.

BIG MISTAKE the stroller was so large, heavy, and unmanagable we only used it about three to five times. We finally ended up purchasing a maclaren stroller that was feather light and extremely durable. We loved it! So when the time came around to purchase a new car seat for the current bun-in-oven we didn't even think twice. We purchased a Graco Safe Seat and this stroller. I got both today -- I LOVE this stroller. Super light weight, compact, easy to use. The adjustments that were necessary to accommodate the car seat were as simple as unscrewing two screws. This is by far the best stroller purchase we've made. I can't wait to use it with a baby inside...as it is, my son is having a great time pushing it around the house.

I started out with theAmerican Plastic Toy 37 Piece Deluxe Workbenchand you can see my review of that product here. That one was easier to put together than this product, but this one is bigger and more complicated.It does require full assembly, but that's why I said this for those who would rather invest your own manpower and time than money. I am always surprised, although I don't know why, that people don't always read the instructions. I hate to see this product get bad reviews because of the ineptitude of others, which is why I'm writing this review. Hopefully you will find this a helpful positive review. This product requires two tools to be assembled which are in big pictures on the box and instruction manual. A screwdriver (a flat head is pictured, but I found a Philips head to be more useful - either will work with the included screws) and a PAIR OF CUTTING PLIERS - NOT SCISSORS. There is no picture of scissors on the box, it is obviously a pair of cutting pliers - a tool that makes flush cuts. I bought these -Xuron 170-II Micro-Shear Flush Cutterspecifically for putting this together and it is well worth the $6 investment. If you do not use flush cutters and try to snap out the pieces or use scissors, of course you are going to get rough edges, because you are using the WRONG tools! But anyway... enough about the daft.If you use the micro shears I recommend, then I also recommend cutting the pieces out while looking at them from the underside. This allows the cuts to be perfect and unnoticeable (and of course NO rough edges of any sort). If you do get a rough edge because you decided to snap them or used some other inferior cutting tool, you can easily repair the mistake with the micro shears. And it is a breeze to cut them out with the Xuron tool - no effort. But this isn't a review for the Xuron micro shears.I inventoried the entire contents before putting it together and found that I had one screw malformed - it was bent and stripped, but they included extra screws in the package, so that was not a problem. However, to test their customer service, I called the company and they were perfectly happy to send me out a new package that day. It does take a while to assemble, but I wanted it assembled before presenting to my child as I think all large presents should be so they can begin playing with it immediately. Everything works well and it is a good size for 2 year old plus (although I don't think my 2 year old can reach the microwave yet. The faucet is a little weird, it comes out, I'm guessing they intended it to be a ""sprayer"", but it just doesn't work for me. The burners and accompanying utensils are on the small size, but the overall unit is a good size and I'm happy with the the size of the space behind the doors. I got this for 50% off retail and am thrilled with the value I received. Other kitchens this size that come fully assembled (or close to it) are in the $100 range.So, if you don't like putting stuff together, I don't recommend this product. But if you want to spend a little of your own time and save a ton of money, find this product at a price you can live with and invest an extra $6 for some micro shears if you don't have a comparable product at home.

30403,B000K0WNM8,Thread Genie - Magic Invisible Thread,AEY5D54UKWTSN,5/5,2.0,1309046400,"The reel rewind is weak and based on twisting elastic thread. Although there is a lot of thread on the reel, the retracting elastic gets too tight and breaks when about 6 feet of thread is extended.Additionally, the thread on my reel had taken on the curve of the reel, instead of lying flat. I expect that the thread is twisted as it is placed on the device, causing this flaw. This caused it to have a curvy wave like very curly hair. The result was that the I.T. was more obviously reflecting every light source than if it was strait.

So DoDads are expenses that spring-up on you unexpectedly and you have to take care of them when they show up, same way some one mentioned that the you get a child and you do not have the option not to have one!

Just kidding... but if you are married or even living together, a child may happen, and its not just your significant other but your niece/nephew/granddaughter/brother-in-law may need you to take them in tomorrow God forbid, then what happens??? Are you going to abandon your family??? If Yes!

What do you do ????Life throws a dice for you every day, there are opportunities out there every day, it's up to us to grab them, and this game tries to teach you how to recognize the opportunities and how to plan for one if you see it come your way.I played this game with a friend a week ago and just purchased my own set.I got out of the RAT RACE in the first 1/2 hour, every time I played in a group of 5 people, but I attribute that to playing smart, not that I got lucky.BUT I take the lesson this game provides and hopefully will be able to apply the knowledge to get positive Cash Flow!!!!",toys games,games,board games,424

That aroma is created during the tea's smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long.

Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look.

I noted that one woman complained about irritation and welts, and that another woman said her husband claimed that the woman experienced irritation because she pressed down too hard with the razor.

Bravely, I used it on my legs. I had no irritation whatsoever on my legs, and got a very nice shave.The underarm irritation lasted over a week. Once the irritation was gone, I tried the razor again. (I thought that maybe the irritation came because it was the very first use of the razor. Also, the instructions say that it takes three uses for your skin to get used to the razor.)Unfortunately, I again experienced irritation. It was not as bad as the first time, but was present for over a week.I don't know if eventually the razor will stop irritating my underarms or not, but I am disappointed in the product.

This is the first electric razor I have purchased in at least a decade.I gave it three stars because it does shave nicely on my legs (and even the bikini area - if you are gentle and careful), but I really needed it for my underarms (the hair grows faster and is more obvious there.)I hope this review helps you make an informed choice.-Donna >&lt;>Update",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,273

If I've lathered and cleaned the brush maybe a dozen time, I've never had more than few hairs come out each time and I've never had any hair in my lather or on my face. I didn't notice much of any smell when it was new, but after a few uses it only smells like whatever shaving creme soap I used last. I do find it to be just a little rough feeling on my face when lathering, but that may just be because it's new and needs to be broken in or because it's inexpensive with lower grade badger hair.

It seemed alright at first, the first week. But, I have to scoop every day and empty the bin every day. If I miss one day it will over flow. I don't know how anyone could only empty this once a week, not even for just one cat.I am writing this review to save you some sleep. It has a loud motor. The rake gives up when raking and keeps trying to clean the box but the clumping litter sometime makes it stop. It keeps trying... all night... until I get up at 2 am to scoop poo. Really!! I don't think any other litter box will wake you up to scoop poo! It doesn't matter how high you fill the line, it doesn't really clean all the box, you need to scoop every day.The rake sometimes pushes the poop backwards after in goes between the rake and then hides it. Somehow, there is always litter leaking onto the tiles under the box.This was a large investment, so I need to make it work for a while, so here are the tricks to live with this box until you can get a better one.1- use a plastic grocery bag (without any holes) to line the waste receptacle. This way you can switch out the bag every day instead of switching out the receptacle.2- keep a hand vac right next to the box so you can vacuum up all the loose litter that somehow gets everywhere every day. It makes easier clean up, but you need to vacuum around the box and under the receptacle every day when you change it or it gets everywhere.3- make sure you use clumping litter. If it is loose, it doesn't clean, if it is really hard the motor isn't strong enough to push it. So, you loose no matter what. I have found that fresh step keeps the odor under control better than other litters.4- use two sided tape on the lid of the bin on the outside, because the cats like to scratch it open to try to get to the poo in the bin to try to cover it and will break it open with their claws. IF you have 2 sided tape there for a week, they give up ripping it open.5- Also line the receptacle lid with a plastic bag. Sometimes the poo that gets raked into the bin gets stuck to the lid and it is gross and makes you replace the bin lid. I have refused to buy more bins since the cost for the box was crazy high.Good luck. For now, cleaning the litter box is the part time job I have after working all day and going to school at night. I am a complete litter slave until they come up with something that actually works.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,495

It worked for 2 oz and then quit again. Called the company again and they said they would ship new pieces to us since it must be a problem with the seal. However, they would not express ship and we had to wait 8 days for the parts. In the meantime, we rented a Medela from the hospital.At this point, I wish we had just rented to begin with.

No more backaches, waking up on my side, or tossing and turning in an attempt to get comfortable.I purchased this pillow towards the end of my second trimester of pregnancy, but wish I had made the investment earlier. Pre-pregnancy I was mainly a stomach sleeper, so I struggled to get comfortable as my belly grew and that was no longer an option. I was using 5 different pillows, including a regular body pillow, in an attempt to get comfortable, but would still struggle to fall asleep, wake up often during the night, and get up with an achy back. I also frequently woke up on my back which is not a recommended position during the second half of pregnancy.The Leachco pillow has replaced all my other pillows. I use it with the open part at my legs, so I don't even need a separate pillow for my head, and I can switch from side to side without rearranging any pillows at night. This pillow supports my back and belly perfectly (I am 5'1""), as well as keeps my hips in a comfortable position (I swing one leg over the long part). I highly recommend it to stomach sleepers, as you can use it to get in a leaning forward side position (sort of half way between on your stomach and on your side) with your belly comfortably cushioned by the long part of the pillow (this is as close to on my stomach as I think I am going to get until after baby).I can't say the cover is made of the nicest fabric, but it doesn't seem to bother my sensitive skin and is removable, so it is easily washed. For extra softness, and so I don't have to wash it as often, I simply lay a regular a pillow case over the top portion where my head rests.If you think this pillow might help you sleep better, but aren't sure if you want to make the investment, I encourage you to go for it and not wait any longer. If you are nervous about the size, I have a queen bed and the pillow, my husband, and I, all fit just fine. Maybe it isn't right for everyone, but it has given me back many hours of sleep and took away many aches and pains, so it is very worth it to me.",baby products,pregnancy maternity,maternity pillows,402

It does sting a little if used in more intimate areas, but that too, seems to lessen over time. It is certainly a tremendous improvement over the first epilady from 15 years ago, which caused ingrowns and never really worked properly.In using this, one gets maximum results by keeping the skin taut. It is essential to exfoliate daily to prevent ingrowns. One one's legs, this works as well as waxing, and it is certainly MUCH easier to take to Europe for 2 months than a tub of hot wax.The biggest failure of this item is it's size, which requires a relatively flat area of body of roughly 2 inches across. The epilady slides effortlessly over the legs, but there is not 2 inches of flat body on one's underarms or bikini area!

My dedicated wax-eater took one bite and has not aimed them at her mouth since.-They do not have wrappers so your toddler does not need you to repeatedly ""open it"".-They come in a fairly durable, handy plastic case.-They are triangular an thus, do not roll (under the couch, for example).Cons:-I have a hard time seeing how I could efficiently sharpen these. Advice in the comments section (besides using one of my dear kitchen knives) is welcome...My daughter has used the Crayola jumbo-sized crayons and while those are not bad, these are definitely superior. In my opinion, they are worth the price.Edited 24 January 2011:I will also add that now, two years later, we bought the new Crayola triangle crayons since these were getting a little worn down.

Being a kid myself (I AM 11)I have to disagree with all you Bratz criticizers. When kids look at Bratz they don't think ""Oh, I want to sneak out on a Secret Date too!"" and ""I want to dress like that!"" Most of the time (Well, Sometimes)kids will have a nice innocent game of Bratz,with them going to school, the mall, and maybe hanging with their guy friends.Now, on the positive side of Bratz.

Both basils shoot right out of their pods. The Dill and Cilantro are growing tall, and there is lots of mint, but it is tiny. The chives are looped back into the sponge & have yet to try to stand up straight, and the Oregano is sprouting within the sponge, but has yet to come out of hiding. And this is at the beginning of week 2. I believe I could probably harvest a little basil at the end of week 3.The big question is, where is the Parsley? People have suggested they substitute Parsley for Oregano. I'd rather they replace the Red Rubin basil. I have recipes with oregano, but none specifically calling for purple basil. However, I never tasted the stuff, so I may change my mind once I do. Hopefully they included it becase of taste and not for looks.This is an easy, low maintenence kit. You only have to refil the water bowl when the water gets low & add 2 nutrient tablets every 2 weeks. It comes with 2 starter nutrients, 2 sprouting nutrients & 12 regular nutrient tablets They ask you to place the pods in the order they came in the box. Possibly because of slightly variable light levels.

We shouldn't have worried-- both cats took to the litterbox just fine and actually use it more frequently than they did our previous litterbox. For our cat with urinary problems, this is an added bonus since cats tend to develop urinary problems partly due to not using the box frequently enough.

I kept one as a gift for a friend with 100lb rottie, and kept the other for when my young mutt gets bigger.-I ordered the translucent gray my pit/lab, which looked wonderful against his black fur, and the translucent green for my mutt, which looks phenomenal on his coat!-After several months, I have found that they are super easy to clean, have not been damaged by even the roughest and toughest of players, are sturdy enough for pullers, and my favorite plus is the collars DON'T STINK over time like nylon or other material collars.-On the downside, I found that the name tag was a clever idea, but since the boys play rough...within a month the name tags popped out and are forever lost.

This was an obvious must-have. However, I've never been the type to spend more than about $7 on nail polish. After hemming, hawing, goal-setting, scrimping, and lip-biting, I can say that this polish is worth it.I've found that it looks best layered over a dark solid color (I like black) - the base of this polish is blue but if you want opaque, you're looking at using a lot of layers of a fairly pricey polish. The sparkle is beautiful and the large and small glitter pieces make it interesting and give your nails a lovely deep color. Even over a dark base coat I feel the polish looks best with at least 3 coats, and of course topped with a glossy topcoat to make everything really shine and to even out the texture. It seems to take longer to dry than other glitter polishes I've used (namely OPI), but if you're painting your nails you probably don't have much planned in the next half hour anyway.As with all glitter polishes, you're going to want a pure acetone remover and lots of patience when it's time to take it off. I do find that it doesn't peel as easily as OPI glitter, which is a TERRIBLE habit on my part.Also, in a couple places I've seen this referred to as a gel polish - it is NOT a gel polish.

The only difference I can tell between the two is that this one will not work unless the battery is charged (that is you cannot run it off of AC power). The problem with this is that the battery charge doesn't last long, and I frequently forget to plug it in, and it takes a long time to charge--so if you needed to trim before heading out the door and forgot to leave this plugged in, you're out of luck.I wrote Remington an e-mail with a suggestion that they bring back the MB-300 model back in October 2011, but they never responded.

6229,B0000532YP,Kiss My Face Soap Oz Bar Soap,A26HFSVLAGULIM,14/17,5.0,1142985600,"This ""All-Natural"" soap is the best for dry, sensitive skin that we've tried so far. It really is made with lots of olive oil which is why it is green, and it seems to be hypoallergenic too! The real bonus comes in the form of the fresh moisturized feeling one gets with each use. The perfumes and other additives which are NOT in this soap are NOT missed. For us, this has become the soap for most applications, with Lava being reserved for grease or stains.In our experience, using this soap for just a month or so will greatly alleviate chronic dry skin, and this is even more obvious on men than women. Using this ""Pure Olive Oil Soap"" for baths and showers really puts its moisturizing effects into overdrive, something that I expected but which really surprised and impressed my husband.Now everyone in our household wants this incredible soap in a liquid with a pump action!

39029,B00028LGDK,Smoked Montreal Beef Brisket 3 1/2 lbs.,AHYRTWABDAG1H,0/0,5.0,1340755200,"Before I post my review, I'll state the following:I've never been to Montreal so I can't compare this to the meat found in an actual Montreal, Quebec deli.This product is from the USA, but at least according to wikipedia it's from an area of the USA that does produce a ""true"" Montreal beef brisket, although the article also implies that some feel that only brisket from Montreal is the ""true"" Montreal beef brisket.Give the two items above, I found this product to be excellent. Smokey without being overpowering, tender and quite fresh despite being sliced and then vacuum sealed. The pepper along the edges of each slice add a bit as well, but again it's far from overpowering. This works well, cold or warm as a sandwich meat, or heated as sliced meat on a plate.Product shipped very fast, and was well packaged. Despite my getting home late and thus the package sitting for nearly 2 hours (I'm single and I couldn't arrange for someone to pick it up for me) it was still quite cold, being packaged in (if memory serves) a styrofoam box with ""blue ice"" (not the actual brand, but something similar, a gelled ""ice"" that is at least in theory reusuable). As currently advertised as of June 2012, it was in (again if memory serves) individual one pound packages and again both pre-sliced and fully cooked. Fat content is fine in my opinion, although I haven't tried making an au-jus with it like apparently one reviewer did when he possibly mistook this for pastrami (he doesn't mention au-jus, but does mention a ""pastrami dip""). The one time I did reheat it though, I didn't see enough ""drippings"" to make anything like an au-jus.Anyway, when I do run out I'm going to consider this product again.

12635,B000GGD3O8,North States Supergate Auto-Close Metal Gate,A3ELP2H0N3ZAX1,119/120,3.0,1201737600,"After a long search for a quality top-of-stairs gate, this is what I decided to buy. Although it works OK it could be better.Two things really bother me about this gate. First, Amazon is selling it as a pressure-mounted gate. This isn't exactly true. While technically it is pressure-mounted, you also need to use the cups that come with and either stick them on or screw them into the wall. This gate is not designed to have a firm mount, it uses hand wheels to adjust tension. As a result, it's not sturdy enough to use without the wall mount cups, meaning you won't be able to move it around much. The hand wheels are ""tamper proof"", basically meaning that they are a pain to loosen. Since this gate can't be set up in multiple places easily anyway, this shouldn't be a problem. Nevertheless, I would prefer wrench-adjusted tension for a more secure fit and the ability to mount the gate without the cups. This would require a redesign, as it doesn't take much pressure to close the gap at the top when installing (compared to true pressure-mounted gates).Second, I thought this gate was made in the USA. This statement is prominently displayed on North State's website today. But it is actually now made in China. This was a factor in my decision and I don't appreciate inaccurate websites.Now, to the details. This gate was easy to setup and did not require any tools. Previously I had purchased a Summer Infant Extra Tall gate but returned it because I was not satisfied with the gate mechanism. I couldn't get it to operate both smoothly and safely at the same time. The release mechanism on this North States gate works very well. The auto-close feature also works well. However, whether or not you will like that feature is another thing.It became immediately apparent that the auto-close feature can be a pain in a high-traffic area. Keep in mind this gate is not easy to remove, so once installed you will need to open it each and every time you go through it unless you rig up your own doorstop to hold it open. The main advantage is that it will always be closed, and that makes it safer. I prefer the safety, but I can see where some people might get annoyed.It also closes with a fairly loud clang, which can be a nuisance when you have a sleeping baby. The metal latch is pulled into place by a magnet so even if you manually close the gate, it will probably clang, although sometimes you get lucky and it doesn't. A little duct tape over the magnet helps.Another thing to keep in mind is that since this is a top-of-stairs gate, it will only open in one direction and it cannot be setup to operate in both directions at the same time.As with all pressure-mount gates, there is a steel bar at the bottom of the gate that you will need to step over.All in all, this is still the best top-of-stairs gate I have been able to find. It does the job I need it to. But obviously it isn't the most flexible gate and there is a lot of room for improvement. If you don't need a top-of-stairs gate, I would recommend The First Years Hands Free gate, which we use in our kitchen. But please remember that if you need a gate at the top of the stairs, there are only a handful available that are designed for this, and they are all hardware mounted.UPDATE 8/11**********************A commenter has stated this gate now opens in both directions, which would make it unsuitable for top of stairs use. I don't know if the design changed of if the commenter has a slightly different model, but buyer beware.",baby products,safety,gates doorways,637

Not that she isn't cute as button also but my daughter already has at least 6 blond haired blue eyed dolls and she isn't even blond! I purchased the model that has the olive skin tone-looks latino or indian to me-and I'm so happy. I love that it comes in a safety seat, it teaches that safety is important.

Unlike ordinary socks, these socks have a number of benefits over conventional socks. To start with, they're non-slip, so walking across polished wooden floors or vinyl covered floors becomes less of a threat to skidding or slipping over, what is also nice about these socks is that the textured grip doesn't bother the bottom of your feet when you wear them in shoes (unlike some slipper socks which are just uncomfortable when you wear them in shoes/sneekers). The elastic top is nicely balanced between offering a good grip without restricting blood flow, also the socks don't spin on the foot, thus it doesn't expose the non-grip side to the floor - they stay put.

I wanted to take care of both additions to my hair and was recommended by my colorist to purchase Redken. Her salon offered the product but being a wise buyer I declined her offer to purchase from her and went to the Amazon website and took care of business. I'm still using the product and it's been a while but the bottles are very big and should last a while. The promise to keep your color lasting longer has been kept and I love the way my hair is easy to comb after shampooing and condtitiong. I find that I only need a very small amount of condtioner and only need to leave it on for just a few seconds; well around 30 seconds then rinse. I have fine hair and leaving on longer would take out some of the body. I think this shampoo would be great for any hair to be honest. I remember one time on Oprah that they were saying that the shampoo isn't a big deal that most of them are alike and put your money into the conditioner. Well for me I think both are important and I would invest in a shampoo that doesn's strip your color or perm out of your hair. I would recommend this product to anyone and will be buying again.

21069,B00008PW02,Hasbro Playskool Crew Dusty The Talking Vacuum,A3JPFWKS83R49V,1/1,4.0,1261440000,"Playskool Cool Crew Dusty Talking Vacuum is a cute toy that gives children the chance to imitate adults and older siblings in the act of cleaning. Children like to do the things they observe others doing and with this Playskool vacuum, kids can experience the sounds and actions of a vacuum cleaner, giving them the feeling that they are right there, next to mom and dad, keeping the home clean and livable.This vacuum is fun for toddlers for several reasons. First, it offers the open view of the inside, where kids can watch the swirling ""lint"" as they push the vacuum across the floor. This makes the vacuum look and seem like the actual vacuum that mom and dad use every week. Second, kids like the cute sayings and will often repeat them as they play. Dusty makes comments such as Who Spilled the Beans, Nobody Cleans Better than We Do, and more. Dusty talks to the child and talks back and forth with his sidekick- the attached brush. Kids will like the sayings and many will look forward to listening to Dusty talk about the cleaning task and how well they are doing.Many children's toys that include sounds are quite noisy, but this is one area where the Playskool Cool Crew Dusty Talking Vacuum is different. There are some sounds with this toy, but they are muffled and shouldn't bother anyone. Some toys offer loud noises and, worse, some do not have a switch to reduce the noise level. This vacuum doesn't have a switch to reduce the sound, but there is an on/off switch to stop the sound completely. The cool thing about turning off the sound is that the swirling and eye moments will still continue, and this could be enough to satisfy many children.As for fun and entertainment, this toy ranks above average, but one thing I have noticed with my girls is that they never play with it for very long. They continue to use it on a regular basis, which shows that it does have a certain appeal. However, they will push it back and forth for only about a minute or so, then set it aside in favor of other toys. This result would lead one to conclude that their interest is low, but the fact remains that they still reach for the vacuum on a regular basis. Even though it holds their interest for a very brief period of time, they still like it for its short burst of stimulation.Playskool Cool Crew Dusty Talking Vacuum is a fun toy for boys or girls in the preschool age group. It is very lightweight, makes little noise, and requires only a simple push across a floor to get it going. It isn't a huge hit with my youngsters, but they do like it consistently, even if only in small doses. It is a good toy that helps children feel like they are helping mom and dad while having a little fun in the process.",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play,500

16361,B000MKHQG4,"CatGenie-Self Washing, Self Flushing Cat Box",A33WNFK1517MJ,2/2,4.0,1229731200,"I must say that I was thrilled about the arrival of the cat genie, eventhough it took several tricks to get it to work in the laundry room (the drain was not big enough to fit the cleanout hose). Once it was setup, I was thrilled. It worked great for about a month or so.I was made aware of my first in a series of problems with the unit getting clogged. The company has sense come out with a new impeller unit, which so far has solved any problems that we had with the unit becoming clogged. I must say, that when the customer support person said to get out ""several old towels and rubber gloves"" I had no idea of what I was in for. All I can say is piss soup is not something you want to encounter everyday. Since the company sent out a new impeller unit (they may have changed more than just the impeller, as they sent an entirely new inside unit for free), the only other trouble I have had is with the cartridges themselves.On 3 occasions the cartridges failed to work. Unfortunately, on one of these occasions we were out of town and for whatever reason, the unit got stuck in cycle. When we returned, the laundry room where we have the unit was no less than 120 degrees F. The unit running constantly for who knows how long had really heated the place up. All that was needed to do was to lift the cartridge out and then drop it back in. The same cartridge sensed that it was empty far before it actually was. My guess is that it stopped dispensing the liquid cleaner. As stated, this is the 3rd time this has happened, which isn't great since I only change the cartridge every two months (60 cycles).I have one cat, about 2 years old who weighs about 10 lbs. She is very picky with the litter box, and she adjusted to this rather quickly. She has always had a weird habit of peeing right beside the litter box, but this is no fault of the companies, as she does this no matter what type of litter she uses.I rate this unit a 4, mainly because the main defects I had with the unit seemed to be mostly fixed by their updated impellers which are now sent out with the newer units. I would like them to improve the cartridges themselves, and even offer a service to send them back to refill them, as it seems like the argument that you save so much on waste (which is definately is true) isn't as strong when you have to throw something out which could really easily be recycled and reused. We are still trying to figure out how to refill the cartridges ourselves, but I really doubt it is worth our time. This is more of a personal thing with me, as my main reason for getting the unit was to eliminate the stinky waste - which the cat genie does.We have had our unit for well over a year and a half and overall are very happy with it. If we had multiple cats I know it would work well too. For the most part, we never have to think about the unit. The cartridges now come in non-scented too, although I rather like the smell of the cleaning solution.I would recommend this unit to anybody who cringes at cleaning up litter. It is actually a pretty neat solution, and I think the company is constantly working to improve the unit.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,600

It's an adult orange soda that I would not have liked as a kid. Yesterday, I bought some egg nog at Safeway, and they had some cold bottles of Southern Comfort alongside the egg nog (smart cross-sell). I bought both (sucker). Frankly, I didn't like the taste of the Southern Comfort in the egg nog. Today, I tried a little Southern Comfort straight up, but found the smell and taste, slightly peachy or bubble gum - not grossly so, but too sweet. I did a review on the Southern Comfort and others also describe the peach aroma and taste. I probably would not buy Southern Comfort again. Then it struck me that it might go well with the San Pellegrino Aranciata in my refer (kind of like a fuzzy navel). Of course, often an idea doesn't play out that well. I poured about 1 ounce of Southern Comfort onto the ice in a cognac glass and then added 2 ounces of the San Pellegrino Aranciata. It smells very nice, tastes delicious, and the bitter of the orange peel balances out the sweetness of the peach in the Comfort - it's much more subtle and drinkable than a typically syrupy sweet fuzzy navel - a more sophisticated version. This is a great all-season sexy drink that everyone will like. My only caution would be that it tastes too good and goes down way too easily.

The instructions are a little vague, but we got it together, and it fits nicely in our basement/playroom (it pretty much takes up all the space though). What a fun toy! The clubhouse has little barstools, a memo board, and a ""working"" cell phone. The slide is fast but fun. Our 21 month old can go down it on his own (I have the foam interlocking puzzle pieces below it to cushion any falls). It also seems like it will hold his interest for many years, and it is very durable. I can climb on it, go across the bridge, and down the slide (I am roughly 150 lbs., the max is 240).

This one was just right, especially for a kid that was already picking up anything that even vaguely looked like a guitar and pretending to rock out with it (though he stopped using a toy violin when he found out it wasn't actually a guitar!). One of the other reviewers said, ""I can't imagine any child over 4 being happy with the item"" - this is what finally made me choose the B2. My grandson really loves it, and everyone else in the family has enjoyed messing around with it a little as well. Sounds are really good, but you can't hear them without using external speakers (computer or MP3 speakers work nicely), or headphones (recommended!). Not sure how ""educational"" this is, since it's not going to teach a kid anything about playing a real guitar. The only real negative, in my opinion, is with the iPod connection cable - it can't be removed and is always dangling.

She is in a phase of life where she isn't interested in staying in the stroller for very long and she doesn't always want to hold our hands, so I thought this might be a good compromise when she wouldn't stay in the stroller. I started getting her used to it a couple of weeks before our vacation by just putting on her the backpack part (without the harness attached), and then I would wear my backpack too when we would go out on walks around the neighborhood. I figured if she saw that I wore a backpack too, she would be more excited about keeping it on. She loved the giraffe stuffed animal look, and even when she wasn't wearing it, she sometimes enjoyed cuddling it. By the time we got to Disney World, she was pretty good about wearing it, and if she was refusing to hold our hands, I could just strap on the harness so that we were still able to keep tabs on her in the crowds. It was a handy thing to have and made us feel more secure about letting her walk in the busy, crowded parks. The only thing I wish was different about it is the pocket--it would be nice if it was bigger so that it could actually hold something bigger than, say, a yo-yo. But it does fulfill it's main purpose of being a cute, comfortable, kid-friendly safety harness, and I was grateful for it on our vacation.",baby products,safety,harnesses leashes,266

The reason being, I've taken them in the past, mostly vitamins (not minerals), and to be honest with you I didn't feel any better. My feeling is if it doesn't do anything for you why take it???Here's why I changed my mind and decided to try magnesium:One day I just happened to be watching TV and saw this doctor by the name of Carolyn Dean, M.D. ND on a show called 'Your Health' talking about the many benefits of taking magnesium.Many health problems such as insomnia, diabetes, asthma, to migraines to heart disease, etc. can be treated with magnesium. One of the major benefits is it relaxes your muscles. I was intrigued, it almost sounded too good to be true.Long story short, I started taking magnesium taurate (by Cardiovascular Research) about 3 weeks ago and used it for my on and off insomnia that I had been having for the past two years. Not having high expectations (because of my past experiences) I wasn't expecting much. Boy was I wrong! The first night I took it I fell into a deep sleep, like 1-2-3, and woke up extremely refreshed. I couldn't believe it. 3 weeks later I can still fall asleep right after taking the pill, it isn't a fluke.

Also, technically it's not the KONG material that tore, it appears to be the stitching around the bottom that she ripped through.

A couple of things i noticed though. First when the grass was tall enough my cat pulled out the seed pod and i found it on the ground. I dont know if i didnt push it down far enough so that it clipped but she did it a couple of times. Anyways i have pushed it down with the roots and it is holding. The next day i found a trail of red ants going for it. I guess wheat grass is just as appealing to bugs as it is to cats!. I cleaned the area with soap and moved the dish but im going to pay extra attention for bugs. The other thing is that you will be pulling out floating grass every now and then. All in all though my cat loves it which was the reason why i got it. Whenever i see her go by she munches on it and i think it should last hopefully another week. If the bugs find it again i might move it to the 2nd floor or just buy potted wheat grass.

So if you are medicating your tank you can remove the carbon so that the drug you add does not get filtered.Or you can put other inserts like ammonia removing pellets instead of carbon pellets.. and so..The only downside of this filter is starting up after getting unplugged. Once the filter stops working for a reason( loss of power or after removing for maintenance)it won't not able to suck water from the tank at first. You have to add water from the top to start the circulation.Oh... one other thing..

I have washed all the parts of this playard with several recommended remedies to rid it of the odor but none have been effective in doing so. I don't know where this item was stored before it was shipped but it is dangerous to distribute items for babies or anyone else in this condition. Mildew can be very dangerous if not deadly to people with allergies and respiratory ailments. Babies especially should not be exposed to any odors as strong as this was. The only reason I did not return this item was because I knew that I would only get another one exactly like it. I am not happy wih this purchase . I think that all items should be inspected for problems such as this before they are shipped especially in light of the fact that many people pay extra for express shipping only to get something they can't use. Another thing is that I know Graco products and I am sure that this is not defect in manufacturing.,baby products,gear,playards,194

I even purchased the baby trend carriers to ensure a good, snug fit.First of all its very easy to assemble. You read the directions, and then you arrange the bars to fit the carrier. The only carrier that really doesnt work is the SnugRide, so I wouldnt reccomend getting one if thats what you have. The carriers snap in so easily, and they are secured well (you can also use a strap). I cannot see ANYWAY they would fall out, or even loosen if you are using the stroller properly. The frame comes in black, or navy, we only saw the navy at BRU, so purchased the black off of another website. The handle bar is tall enough for me (5""4) or my husband (6""2) and its a comfortable grip. The cupholders arent the greatest, but they hold a drink, and it usually doesnt wobble out. The tray holds a few smaller things that you need right at your fingertips, and is fairly deep. The underbasket is HUGE and can easily hold a diaperbag for two (though mine is quite small) blankets, jackets, purchases, and anything else you need. Its a bit difficult to reach, but I found going at it from the side between the carriers works best. The stroller navigates much better than that of anyother tandem stroller (the only ones that hold infant carriers) which was important to us. I can also squeeze through racks, and stroll with one hand. Its not much of an ""off roader"" but it can stroll on grass, dirt, concrete and indoor surfaces well. I found it takes two hands to fold it properly, and once folded it takes up minimal space in the trunk of my Lexus RX 300. It also folds well for airline travel, and made it through baggage without damage.Baby trend also has terrific customer service. When putting together my stroller frame, we were missing a very important bar for the front carrier to snap in, and realised that one of the wheels was a bit warped. After calling the store where we ordered the stroller from, they told us to call baby trend. When I told them what piece I was missing, and which one was damgaed, they sent over an extra piece and a replacement to my warped wheel no questions asked, and for no cost, even free shipping!All in all I love this stroller, and it makes getting out with my 6 week old twins very stress-free.

They were never very large, but they continued at this rate until I entered high school. For some reason, I began getting them constantly in 10th grade. And I truly mean constantly. Once one would heal another would show up. Not only were they more frequent, they began getting larger as well. They were always in different parts of my mouth (lower gum, upper gum, back of the mouth, everywhere). The pain was AWFUL! I remember one time, I had pain in the back of my jaw that was so horrible I thought a wisdom tooth was coming in. I went to the Dentist and he told me, no, it's not a wisdom tooth, but a canker sore that was slightly larger than a pinkie nail sitting right on top of my gum where wisdom teeth are supposed to come in. I know that doesn't sound like a huge sore, but I know for any of you that have dealt with canker sores for some time, a ""pinkie nail"" sized one can make your days miserable. I also know exactly how it feels to be in high school, and having to deal with the stigma of canker sores. They can make you feel unattractive, they can be the reason for reschedules dates, and depending on where one decides to show up try having the ""it has nothing to do with herpes!"" conversation more than once.I'm now a Senior in college and Squigle enamel saver toothpaste has literally changed my mouth. I can't stress this enough. I know that any review will be met with criticism, but I hope any of you reading this will look at all of the other positive reviews and at least try it! I have had one, I repeat, ONE canker sore since I started using this toothpaste 8 months ago. ONE CANKER SORE! After having one after the other for years this has been a miracle. I smile about twice as much, I never have to tell my boyfriend he can't kiss me because it hurts, the list goes on.Now as for the product itself, the flavor is what I would equate to a mild Andes mint chocolate. I like it a lot, but it is far from the flavor of any commercial toothpaste. There is also a slight cooling effect because of the Xylitol. Also, you may feel like it's not cleaning your teeth as well as a commercial toothpaste, but I realized a little into using it that I just have to brush my teeth about a minute longer to achieve the same ""slick"" clean feeling that I used to get with my old toothpaste (I used to use Aquafresh if anyone is interested!).

My daughter is 5 so this isn't that much of an issue but it can not fit into any normal doll beds, strollers etc... Her head is HUGE and rubbery so it isn't easy to clean. She is a total mess and honestly she is going back. My daughter loved it the day of christmas but after 3 packets of food and 3 diaper changes, she is bored with it. I knew that would be the case but bought it anyway. She only says a few phrases and once you press her bracelet, you hear a dull buzzing sound for about 3-4 seconds and then her eyes click click click and then she laughs. Everytime her eyes close, it clicks. It is very annoying and not lovable at all. I think the Fisher Price talking toddler doll is much more doll like and a cute normal voice to boot.

It is still going strong with few problems except that the material that it's made with is cheap not to mention plastic. I remedied most of the problems that others had mentioned in their reviews. The product is truly phenomenal in its design. I contacted the company who make these items back in 2007 with an excellent idea as to how they could make millions if only they would construct them out of ""Stainless Steele""! Following is an insert from the email that I sent to them, and they decided to ignore, ""Their Bad"".""Overall I love the product because my pets just love the continuous flow of fresh water, too bad you don't have it in Stainless Steel. Many people won't give their pets anything to eat or drink out of plastic containers. I was really hesitant myself because I don't usually give food or water out of plastic because it isn't good for animals. Foods have acids and other ingredients in it that interact with plastic and hard water, which I have, also reacts with the plastic. The minerals in the hard water corrodes the plastic and wear it out in certain areas. If you made this product out of Stainless Steel you would most likely have twice the customers you have now using it! This is ""FYI"" on what true Pet Lovers buy for their Pets. I only use ceramics or Stainless Steel containers to feed my Pets in. Not only does Stainless Steel last longer but it doesn't interact with food or water.""I have just recently discovered on Amazon.com that they sell another brand from a different manufacturerPioneer Fountain Big Max- Stainless Steelthat's made out of ""Stainless Steele"", but it's design isn't anywhere close to the design of the Auto-Pet Waterer (because it doesn't have a reservoir)from(Ergosys), old name, now the name is different with a slightly different design but they're the same right down to the plastic construction! Plastic isn't good for your pets food or water. Plastic is hard to sanitize properly. I've always fed my Poms' out of Stainless Steele Bowls. I ordered my new bowls(2) on 06/30/2011 and was supposed to have received them yesterday by FedEx according to FedExs' delivery reporting them as being delivered, but obviously FedEx delivered them to the wrong address and I'll have to wait until after the 4th of July before I get them! I was very disappointed because I wanted to introduce my cats and poms to them on the 4th of July. If only Pioneer Pets would make one similar to this plastic one by Ergo with the reservoir, they would make $millions. As stated earlier the plastic model cost too much to be made out of plastic. I can't review the new bowls from Pioneer Pets because I haven't had a chance to use them yet, but when I've had the chance I'll do a follow-up.",pet supplies,cats,feeding watering supplies,505

It never flattens back out.I really liked the fact that it's 100% cotton and the one I already have fits ok but this new one doesn't. They changed the material around the padded part that fits over the mattress and it wasn't a good change.

They lived, but did NOTHING for the entire few months they lived...although we did enjoy seeing them eat the random spider we'd through in there. :) These were tiny little ants that that were so small we had to put a piece of tape over the air holes because they could crawl through! Two days ago we went out in our woods and found a log with the larger ants living in it. After some creative work on my part with a jar and kids 1"" paint brush, I was able to catch some of those. (wait for a sunny day when they are near the surface of their hole) They are already digging and tunneling! We even got some larvae that we hope to see develop! We spent the time during the school year studying ants as a homeschool project, so we were disappointed when the first batch didn't do anything, but now that we have studied them so extensively, we are thrilled to see them build their nurseries, garbage dump, sleeping quarters, etc. Can't wait to see if any males emerge from the larvae! We'll release those if they do!Oh..and very tricky for me to get the ants INTO the farm. After collecting them in a jar, I found a way to separate them from the debris, then put a paper cover on the jar that left a 1-2"" oval opening/pour spout area. I took the cover off the farm and lightly taped a piece of paper the same size as the lid to the top, then poked a hole with a pencil about the size of my funnel that I have. I then poured the ants into the funnel and used the paintbrush to help get them in there and down the funnel. Once in the farm, I sifted through the previously separated debris on a piece of paper to find the larvae, then dumped them down the funnel. When the funnel was not in the hole, I put a small piece of tape over the hole. After everyone was in safe and sound, I waited for them to settle down, then quickly and gently removed the paper and replaced the lid. There has got to be an easier way to do this, but this is what we figured out and I thought I'd post it here in case someone finds themselves stuck in the same place we were with...how do we get these into the farm and not all over the counter or porch?",toys games,learning education,habitats,435

I have had other breeds of dogs (German Shepherds, Rotties, etc... with no problems), but I was amazed how big he got and how fast it happened. Rigdgebacks are very stubborn dogs on top of all of this. They are a breed that if not trained to know who the boss is, will continually test their limits.I tried training classes, chokers, and finally a pinch collar. He didn't even flinch, nor did he ever listen. I have a four year old son who was frightened by him, not because he was mean, but because he would knock him over, climb all over him and scratch him with his paws while trying to play with him. He just did what he wanted when he wanted. He would run full force into me and wipe me out, knocking me on the ground with his enthusiasm. He tackled strangers, tables, anything he wanted. Never in a mean way, he never growled or anything close to showing aggression. He was fine with anyone near his crate or food bowl, so he wasn't a mean dog. He was just out of control. He was meant to be an indoor dog, but his behavior had him spending most of time in our yard. I was saddened that I might have to find him a new home.This collar was my last option and I am so glad that I tried it. I was so afraid that it wouldn't be strong enough and he wouldn't respond. He has a very high pain threshold. But I was greatly surprised. After 5 minutes on this collar he was no longer knocking me over. My first goal was to teach him ""no."" It took about 4 times to say it with the collar on and pressing the button, before he was responding to ""no"" without me having to press any buttons. He is great to be around now. He still charges me when he sees me and is excited, but he comes to a complete stop about a foot in front of me and then sits for me to pet him and love on him. I don't even need him on a leash anymore. He responds to my commands easily.On the technical aspects of this product, I love that it is completely waterproof, not just water resistant. We have two ponds on our property that he loves to jump in. So that is a great benefit. The remote is small and easy to use. And it is also waterproof. Both can be submerged completely in water and be fine. This is not considered a ""throw away"" collar, meaning if it is broke, you can still fix it. I looked at the models that were cheaper by other companies, but for a little more in price, I was able to get one that would last much longer.Needless to say, I love this collar!

I prefer to describe her as a large small dog. She wears a 15 "" collar and many collars either go up to 14"" or start at 16"" and are either too tight or too large.Most of the time, I have to take her shopping to find the correct fit. Pet stores within dog walking distance of me don't carry the full variety of sizes and styles and colors to satisfy both dog and dog owner. We are both quite discriminating. When it came time to replace Wandrdog's old martingale collar and well-gnawed and patched leash, I spotted a chic black and metallic silver, woven nylon leopard pattern leash by Lupine but alas, there were no coordinating collars in the local store.Luckily, Lupine offers a good selection directly from Amazon and with some searching, I was able to locate a martingale collar and matching leashLupine 3/4-Inch Wild Thing 6 -Foot Leadin ""Wild Thing"", the pattern I wanted. This ""combo collar"" works both as a martingale and a standard collar. It fits over the heard as does a standard martingale but instead of round or D-shaped rings, the smaller martingale loop passes through narrow, squared rings. The leash can either be attached to a D ring on the small loop for use as a martingale, or to a D ring on the large loop when used as a standard collar. I don't plan to use this as a standard collar but as a martingale, it works extremely well. I purchased the ""w; 14-20"" neck size and it was easily adjustable to a perfect fit for Wandrdog's 15 "" neck.The collar is extremely well made from tightly woven, jacquard nylon webbing. Unlike other manufacturers, Lupine's designs are woven into the webbing and never printed or sewn on top. The rings are made of welded metal and are strong and secure as is the plastic buckle that adjusts the size. Lupine manufactures its products in Conway, New Hampshire and offers a life time guarantee.....even if chewed.Wandrdog is so pleased with her new collar and leash that she promises that she will never, never chew them!

BTW this thing is leaping off the shelves..Ok I bought this thing... Only to find out you gotta purchase the battery & Charger seperately. So I went back to walmart, they had no more XPVs (Sold Out) But they had piles of the Battery/Charger packs. Which tells me there are going to be a ton of excited kids Xmas morning only to find out they cant do squat with it until mommy/daddy fork over another $29.95 for the battery & charger.. :( THey need to make the labeling and requirements for that more obvious.The box says 8 years old and up. Nonsense! I would not give this to a kid younger than 11 or 12. An 8 yr old unsupervised will destroy it in less than 1hr..THIS THING IS FAST!!! I will say that.. This thing has tons of thrust and more than enough needed to get off the ground. Its rare an electric R/C plane has enough get-up-and-go to get itself off the ground. They advertise this as a ground or air vehicle. Let me suggest it is an airplane with limited ground capabilities. The wheels on this thing are just too light wieght and flimsy for regular power slides and drifting. Mine broke a front wheel hitting a curb. I managed to fix it myself with tape but its not pretty.Flying the XPV is where its at. An absolute blast. This thing really GOES... It is a bit heavy though and needs a lot of speed. It can take off from the ground but it takes a lot of energy. So do a hand launch and save power. Do not expect to fly this thing in front of your house.. It needs a lot of space and you will crash it into the neighbors cars, house, trees. Get an open field. YOU WONT BE FLYING IT IN YOUR BACK YARD - Unless you have an acre or more...I have had a blast flying it in a grassy open field. I flew it in a field that was clod/dirt and its really hard on it when it crashes. The dirt causes the tape no to stick and the clods can damage the plane on crashes (its styrafoam remember!). This thing needs a lot of speed to stay up so get a wide open area.. It will get away from you if your not quick on the controls. I have been able to exceed the radio range of the controller flying it so high (est I got it nearly 400 ft up) which it corrected itself by powering off until I could reach it again. But if its flying away from you it could glide almost out of site. Landing it is fairly easy although it can be hazardous. If you let off the power complely you have no steering control. If there is no wind just let off the power completely about 10-15 ft off the ground and it will guide smoothly. If there is wind keep the throttle on min and you can still steer it a little bit. Because there are no rudders you steer it with thrust.. So no thrust no steer.. But this has the advantage of making it more durable.I have been frustrated with it many of times. Its easy to get this thing in a death spiral and screw it into the ground at a high rate of speed or cartwheel it if you dont get good with the controls. Fly it on a very calm day. Use very short bursts of steering thrust and you will be fine. Keep the speed/throttle up when turning as if you let off that too much it will crash hard. I have done cartwheels and plowed it nose first into the ground many times.Its pretty tough as far as R/C planes go.. VERY TOUGH.. But it still takes damage and requires patching up. Taping up a cracked wing or busted wheel mount changes the flight characteristics. What you do to one side of the XPV take the same amount of tape and apply it to the other side. That should balance it out.I did have a problem with the first battery. It failed and the battery case swelled up. Possibly a factory defect. I will be taking the battery back to walmart. I did buy 2 though and suggest you do as well. That way you have more flying time.Pros",toys games,electronics for kids,unknown,739

The adjustment mechanism feels good and it is easy to see what number it is on.- Worked well for its intended purpose- seems to be made well enough, especially for the priceCons:-Though it doesn't mention one anyway, there was no stand for the unit, which is a little inconvenient.- You cannot use it while it is plugged in. Rather you can, but it wont power the unit. The actual adapter looks like a 3.5 mm headphone jack and plug. Its a bit unusual and I assume that its the reason why it cant be used ""pass thru"".- No warning when power dips too low for use. When I first opened it I tried to test it out without charging. It started fine, but then suddenly slowed to an unusable rate. It appears to have a light on it, but I didn't notice it on when this happened.- While it has quite a number of adjustments, unfortunately the gaps between may be a bit extreme for some people. Also I found that on the lowest setting it wasn't as short as I'd like to see. I ended up using a 4 for the bulk of the trimming, but I will still require the use of my Braun electric for touching up.-Angle is awkward to handle. I found it hard to make consistent strokes due to the severe angle of the head, luckily it doesn't affect the results, just the comfort of use.Conclusion:Overall I think if you maintain any facial hair this is a great tool, however don't expect it to be a one stop tool. That being said it trimmer very well, with no tugging or jamming (my beard is pretty thick). I cant speak for the maintenance free area. They include a small brush to clean out the head, so depending on how you feel, that may be much for you. I found after one charged use it required it (it retains a lot of hair).

I just wanted to comment on the fact that even though it doesn't look exactly the same as the one pictured it is close enough. I did take it out and test it out while my girl was sleeping. It worked beautifly. It popped up with ease and was just as easy to put back in its carrying bag. It seems very sturdy and I think we will have it for a long time even when used outside. It's plenty large enough for two kids. I think four kids could probaly still have a good time inside. My only problem with it is i wish i hadn't ordered it so early cause i can't wait to give it to her!,toys games,sports outdoor play,play tents tunnels,155

Surprisingly in Seoul, many restaurants serve barley tea, called bori-cha as their standard free beverage. Most of my Korean colleagues love it. It is a kind of cultural icon. Growing up with Honey nut Cheerios, I assumed that barley needs honey, so I added honey to my barley tea and it is to die for. My Korean colleagues consider this sacrilege, but I still recommend it.Barley tea is also popular in Japan and Ecuador. Apparently, we are behind in the discovery of this wonderful tea.The taste of barley tea is a bit like regular tea, say Lipton, but softer. Most importantly for me, this tea is healthy and natural. I don't drink coffee, black or green tea for health and personal reasons. Tea made from barley is healthy, refreshing and enjoyable. You must try some.",grocery gourmet food,beverages,tea,148

We were very excited when it arrived. However, I was dismayed to find that you cannot stack your personal piles at all unlike in Dutch Blitz (boy/girl/boy/girl) and there are even more cards numbered 1-13 including stop cards instead of the 1-10 of dutch blitz. The scoring of the random rolling of the die just adds to the ""chance"" winning and requires absolutely no skill. I like games where if you win, it's because SOME skill was involved.The cards are textured which is nice and easier to pick up and put down than Dutch Blitz. They are also a little larger which is a plus. I don't like how the cards' numbers are only read from one direction. At least there is a line under the ""6"". Playing with 2 people isn't very fun and you reach alot of stale mate moments when neither player can move. This game goes much faster and is more fun with 6 players than any other number.Overall, it is an ok game to play with 6 people but definitely not worth the almost twenty buck price.

I bought her two of these perches, one medium and one small. She loves them! These perches are very smooth plastic, so you might want to have a rough perch in the cage to wear down nails. She is a bare-eyed cockatoo so she is smaller than most cockatoo species, but she doesn't seem to have a problem staying on the medium size perch. In fact the medium sized one is her favorite. She doesn't slip or slide on it and it gives her much needed warmth during the chilly days.The cord is wrapped with tightly coiled steel, if your bird is a chewer you might want to supervise or put a plastic wire protector around the cord. The cord is somewhat kept out of reach of the bird, but not as far as the description leads you to believe. Luckily my bird isn't a chewer or else I might be worried. The steel might not be enough to keep a determined bird from chewing through the cord, but again you can purchase a plastic cord protector to wrap around the steel for added protection.My 'too is reluctant to embrace anything new, especially perches. I took her out of her cage while I installed it, and then put her back in her cage and backed her up to the perch. When she turned around it was right there and I just put her onto it before she could protest.

I'll never shave again! It was quite uncomfortable and a bit painful the first time I used it [come on, it pulls your body hair out by the roots...] but since then it has been virtually pain free. The best reward of using this product is not having to bother with hair removal very often -- I can't say exactly how long the overall effect lasts, but I usually do touch-ups once a week on those hairs that were not long enough to pull the week before and it doesn't take but about 15-20 minutes to to a &quot;whole body&quot; once over. I use it on my legs, underarms and bikini line all with equal success. The only drawbacks that I have discovered are occasional problems with ingrown hairs (which has mostly been solved with the added use of a loofah) and the fact that my legs are never as smooth as when I shaved due to some hairs not being long enough to catch at the time of epilation. This has gotten better with repeated use (it appears as if less hair grows back between each use and it grows back soft), but it's still not quite smooth to the touch.

36152,B00008XP0B,Wahl Homepro Haircutting Kit 12 Piece with Video,A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5,0/0,5.0,1329696000,"In 2004 my weekly hair cuts in NYC was approaching $20 + tips and to save money I bought this clipper for $25. My purchase was on a trial basis because if I couldn't learn to use it without butchering my hair it was getting returned. The Wahl HomePro Adjustable was very quick to learn and is very easy to use for regular folks cutting their own hair in their bathrooms.Every Friday morning I've used it to cut my naturally short and curly hair during the last 7 years without any issues. Even when I went to London and Paris in the summers I took it along with a travel adapter. In Paris it worked but in London the AC/DC current was different and the Wahl would vibrate super fast to use safely. So I bought a comparable European clipper at Boots Pharmacy that I keep at my Aunt's house in North London.During the previous few weeks my Wahl was not cutting sharp like it used to. I unscrewed the shear plates and cleaned it out with clipper oil. Still the shears were hardly cutting my hair because it had gotten dull from 7 years of continuous use. I un-boxed and starting using an Emerson clipper that my brother got me a few years ago for Christmas. It was then that I realized how good my HomePro Adjustable was. The Emerson felt like a plastic toy in comparison. I went out and bought another Wahl Homepro brand clipper but found it impossible to use because it lacked the adjustable lever. So I came back to amazon and bought the exact model I had before.After 7 years of use it has proven to be the best thing ever and I 100% recommend it.At $20 + 5 tip x 52 weeks x 7 years I saved $9,100 on account of spending $25 to buy the Wahl HomePro Adjustable.PROS:-Has a nice hefty weight to it which gives it a good balance and feel in your hands.-Super easy to use, blades are smooth and comfortable to the touch.-Comes with adequate attachments and instruction VHS.-Shear blades dismantle easily and quickly for cleaning and replacement.-Easy to travel with.-Proven Lifetime quality.-Great price and value for what you are paying for.-Adjustable Lever makes a HUGE difference for fine tuning your hair cuts.CONS:-I couldn't find replacement shear blades anywhere for this particular model and the ones I did see for other Wahl models cost as much as an entire new Wahl clipper.-Over the years I learned Clipper Oil is crucial to the performance of the blades but the kit comes with a one-time use miniscule tube of clipper oil. Some other clippers come with free big bottles of the stuff but you will have to buy your own here.-Did not work in the UK because of the AC/DC current differences.-I wished the power cord was longer but if you get an extension cord you can easily remedy this.-It is not a quiet clipper but it is not super loud either. I noticed some folks commented on newer model clippers being silent.This is not a con for me but still it will be for those that like to cut their hair in their local Library.-For those looking to cut the hair 'down below' keep in mind this is not a small clipper. It vibrates quickly and is louder than smaller clippers. Also the edges of the shear blades protrude out some and are pointy and sharp. So any soft and sensitive areas below your belly button and above your knees you may want to approach with caution.",beauty,hair care,styling tools,597

Fat Free Fudge Brownie Mix, Original, 13.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)",ADRYHOAJ0BCKU,0/0,5.0,1282521600,"Even non-dieters love these. 1 box, made as per instructions (I use a 6oz container of nonfat vanilla yogurt usually) makes 1 pan, but I find that it makes a decently thick brownie if you use an 8x8 pan and adjust cooking time accordingly. I couldn't spread the whole batter out into a larger pan. The batter is very thick and when all you are adding to the box of powder mix is a small carton of yogurt, it seems unlikely that that small amount of yogurt will turn a bowl of powder into a bowl of batter but if you keep stirring, it does happen. I also tried it using nonfat plain Greek yogurt plus a tsp of vanilla but it was too thick so I had to add a few tablespoons of water and then the batter came out perfect and the brownies were just as great as always. I like that you can do single servings in a bowl in the microwave (I double these as they are pretty small). These brownies are not as gooey and flakey as a regular decadent type but they have more a thicker chewy-ness (like a crust but not hard or flaky) on the bottom and outside edges that some people prefer. For a nice treat, top these brownies with fat free Cool Whip and some sugar free chocolate syrup... diet brownie heaven. They sell this mix in my local supermarket and it's about $3-$5 depending on if there's a sale. These brownies are very sticky when cutting them so it's also good to make them in muffin tins instead of brownie pans.",grocery gourmet food,pantry staples,cooking baking supplies,272

WE use it every day and it holds up to much abuse, but we really bought it because it wasnt pink and frilly, a must with two BOYSOur sons are still a little young to climb all over our very large wooden swing set, and we wanted more for them to play with, this house is just soo awsome. Its a little large, so I dont suggest you purchasing it for indoor use (especially since every side had an activity so it wouldnt be as fun against a wall). It can fit both my boys in it and the weather doesnt do any damage... we plan on covering it with a tarp in the winter though... before our sons go inside we wipe it down with dissinfected wipes and get all the little bugs out for them, no biggy...Now for all the extras!!!SPORTS SIDE->* Basket ball hoop, now we dont have to buy a little one that will just tip over anyway (we have one inside) and our sons love to play with it (they are only in the 32nd percentile) so its a bit tough to make a basket on the highest setting, it can adjust to the top of the house, or to right abouve the soccer net, great for toddlers or older children!!!* The soccer net also doubles as a little window and our sons really love to peek in and out of it... its very durable and there is no ripping in it *yet*... but they like it when my husband shows them to kick the ball inside, and it keeps the air flow throughout the toy house nice and fresh...* The little number game is cute, my sons dont understand it yet, but for older family and friends its a big hitSUPERMARKET->* A little ATM machine, so adorable and my sons cant get enough of it... although the older kids have more imaginative play with that part of the house* The little window alot of the younger toddlers enjoy, its one of their favorite parts of the house, all little kids love opening and closing things, yet again older kids like to make this a McDonalds drive in window or something... great fun* The big window makes it easy to see how the boys are doing inside, and it also keeps it nice and fresh, not too moldy and stuffy like some of the other houses, we like the big windowGAS STATION->* The tunnel is a big hit wiht the toddlers, they like to peek through it, its my sons favorite way to get in! The older kids like to chase through it and try to ""fly"" through...* The little pump is great for kettrikes and cozy coupes, my sons and the other toddlers like putting it into the cars gas tank, they think thats cute, but the older kids sometimes pretend its a hose or something, very cute imaginations* The little telephone is a big hit with everyone, they love pretending with it and I usually find it everywhere but the base, but hey thats no biggy* YEt again more ventalation with the window... I think thats why this house doesnt get too much mold or little bugs... theres just no really dark and damp spaces!SCHOOL HOUSE->* Theres not too much to this side of the house, and it doesnt really look like a school, but the younger kids like slaming the door* The older kids make it a barn and like to pretend its a stable door, very very imaginative* EVEN MORE VENTALATION AND ANOTHER SPOT TO SEE EVERYONE, TWO BIG WINDOWS AND A BARN-DOOR...This house is perfect for toddlers, and bigger kids (up to about 10-11ish) there are just endless possibilities for this house and everyone enjoys it...

Our daughter loves to be swaddled, when we get it right - however, the blankets that we have (even the ones that the hospital used to swaddle her) were not very helpful for easy swaddling. And she works herself loose because she's getting stronger every day.We hoped a blanket cut for swaddling with the velcro would be the solution...However, two problems:1. It doesn't fit properly and she works herself loose despite the velcro - the velcro contact patches are very small - there should be a broader strip of velcro to attach to so it is more adjustable. Our daughter is small, and it is just too big on her. She swims in it. We hope it will work better when she gets bigger.2. Fleece - decent winter solution, but terrible in the summer. And terrible if you keep your house over 60 degrees. If only it came in a lighter material (we haven't found it).Oh well... it definitely seems to work for some, so don't use our review as your only basis.THAT BEING SAID, HOWEVER, we found two other options:1) When our kids were very young (-> 1 month) we used a large waffle weave blanket from Target (~$5) and it worked wonderfully... we can wrap it tight, and she does work herself loose after about 3 hours, but it is better than any of the previous solutions.2) the Amazing Miracle Blanket (another swaddling blanket), was our by far favorite swaddling blanketOne other note about swaddling - whenever she has been properly swaddled (usually by an expert) she loves it... We initially told some folks who have a lot of experience with children that she liked to have her arms loose. the response we got is that most babies behave that way, and it really is the small minority of babies that don't really like swaddling. Now that we know how to do it properly, we would agree.",baby products,nursery,bedding,329

Needless to say, it's been well used and likewise probably well abused. There are no holes in it, the zipper is still working wonderfully, and there are no complaints to speak of as far as the condition of it goes. All 3 trips were made by myself. It is a little awkward to get the stroller into it by yourself but definitely do-able. I used the entire travel system while traveling, and when I had the stroller out I would just fold the bag up (kind of, more like a couple folds then rolling the rest of the way) and stick it between the car seat and the stroller. Fits great there :) We will be moving to England in 2 weeks and will be using this bag.Great purchase!! I had to gate check the carseat on one leg, and it got filthy!

It took the 8oz measure of heating to heat a 4oz bottle that I pumped in. That was the only bottle it would heat. I would heat the milk in the pump bottle and pour it into the other bottles. This is not easy with a screaming baby that wants to be fed. It just wasn't worth the time so I took it back.

The cats wouldn't go near this new shipment of spirulina, and the dog who gulps everything I put in front of her, got diarrhea for three days after I mixed this spirulina into her regular food (Merricks BG Buffalo).To be fair, just in case it might have been the food (Merricks BG Buffalo) that had made my dog ill, I fed the dog the same food without this spirulina. She was fine...no horrid stinky farts and no diarrhea. I waited a week, fed her the same food (Merricks BG Buffalo) adding the spirulina again. Poor dog got diarrhea again.This spirulina comes from India, which explains a lot.What a bummer. I used to trust the NOW FOODS label.

My daughter finds it to be very comfortable as well. The only thing that I don't like about it is that my daughter figured out that the back part that she leans her back against is not attached to the stroller. It is hard to explain you would have to see it for yourself. You can lay the seat down so they can take a nap. It is operated by a drawstring so it is attached but if she leans forward all of the way and then scoots her body forward she can touch her feet to the floor even when in the 5 point harness. If the stroller is not on lock she will pedal herself away which I feel is a saftey hazard. She thinks that it is fun when I am trying to shop and she keeps trying to pedal herself down the isle.

On several experiments, it has induced frustration in my son and unfortunately, dampened his interest in chemistry instead of fostering it. A great example of this is the invisible ink experiment. You are over half way into the experiment before you are told to pull out a feather/ink quill or fine point paint brush (neither of which come with the set.) Next surprise, you are told that slightly yellow paper works best (hmmm, let me see, where is that stock of slightly yellow paper I keep around the house - Ah yes, next to my ink quill.) Finally, you are told that you need to mix up two addition solutions not initially mentioned.Come on, folks. How hard is it to provide a simple ""You will need these items for this experiment list"" at the top of each experiment?Additionally, I think the experiments would be a little more exciting if some more fun was introduced into the manual.

The small kitchen is the perfect size for her, as she likes to sit or squat and play anyway. She enjoys pushing the buttons and putting the shapes in the sorter, as well as opening/closing the fridge/oven/microwave doors. The sounds/tunes are enough to catch her attention. She'll play with it for 3-4 minutes, which is enough for her short attention span. Her almost 2-yr-old cousins, however, weren't interested in it for more than a minute, and our 3-yr-old son stops by every now and then to push its buttons to make some noises. My only disappointment is that the fridge door is very flimsy--the 2-yr-old cousin broke it off within minutes after opening it when he tried to sit on the door. It's not broken, but it falls off a lot.

I regretted it within 2 weeks of purchase. The outer foil started developing a small depression and very soon enlarged to a linear gash that left scrathes on my face after shaving. Since I have been a happy foil shaver for many years, I do not think I was pressing it on my face any more than I did with my previous model. When I compared the outer foils of the Panasonic and Remington, it was soon apparent that the Remington outer foil is of poor quality, very flimsy and quite malleable.The unit was also not easy to hold especially if your wrist is flexed compared to the nice wrap around feel to the Panasonic. The Remmington always felt like it would drop out of my hands anytime, although I never actually did.I would not recommend or buy at least this particular model MS2-390",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,170

Seeing the price and that it was in bags, I knew that it had to be ground and a cheaper grade tea, but I was just looking for a decent low cost Oolong, so I could reserve my good loose leave teas for those quite moments alone and special guest. One thing that irritates me about products sold on the Amazon site, is most of the time there is very little pertinent information regarding the product and sometimes, not even a picture. If I hadn't known how Oolong tea was suppose to be prepared, I would have passed on this one. I was right at guessing that all the writing on the box would be in Chinese and if it says on the box how to prepare it, I can't tell. That said, I bought 5 boxes since it had the right information to indicate that it was indeed from the right area in China to be true Oolong tea and I bought 5 boxes to try.Oolong tea requires a water temperature of 180F and the steep time of no more then 3 minutes. Steep time means how long the tea should be left in the hot water. Use a tea thermometer or a similar one that is capable of accurately reading between 160F and 212F(boiling) and never let the tea stay in the water longer then 3 minutes. A small digital timer works great for sitting next to you to get the timing right. Teas like this, that are from plant leaves, release tannin which makes the tea bitter and the maximum steep time is different for different types. Make sure you know the steep temperature and steep time ahead of time or you will always be disappointed in the results you get. If you like your tea stronger, DO NOT leave the tea in the water longer then the maximum steep time. Put more tea in the pot or cup before you add the hot water and always remove the tea before the tannin starts to be released, instead. If the tea taste bitter to you, then the leaves or tea bags have been in the hot water too long.Some high quality loose leave teas can be resteeped up to 3 times, with a slightly different taste upon each consecutive steeping. Always allow the tea leaves to completely cool down and stop the cooking process before it starts to release tannin and you should be fine using those for a second or even third steeping as long as you always keep removing it from the water before the leaves start releasing tannin.

This position can keep water from spilling out of the bottle when you use the Wet Jet.

The design is very poor, in my opinion, at least compared to other treat toys we've used.To begin with, it is difficult to ""load"" the toy with food and treats because there are two identical loading holes, one opposite the other. This means that when I pour treats in, they pour right out on the opposite side. It's like filling a bucket with no bottom, and it's very frustrating. Eventually, you have to just find the biggest treats you can, and jam them in, which is a pain and a half. Not to mention the edges of the hole catch and grab at your fingers - fun!That brings me to my next point - you cannot put small treats or puppy kibble in here as they will fall out immediately. Only big fat treats will provide the dog a challenge, but fortunately the makers of this product make such treats and are more than willing to sell them to you. Which is fine, I guess, and I went ahead and bought some, but I prefer to fill my treat toys with at least some regular kibble so that the puppy doesn't just gorge himself on a bunch of rich treats all at once. Since this ball won't allow me to do this, it's now an occasional toy, not a reliable daily toy.Bottom line",pet supplies,dogs,toys,244

A few weeks later, I slowly was getting in my Jeep, not used to it yet as it was a new vehicle and I was driving a truck before, pulled the door shut on the left ankle before I got it in the car door. Needless to say its in bad shape! I alread had a Cam walker boot for my right leg, they put me in another one for my left, and its awful! They wont listen when I say its too big, no support around my ankle/under the ankle bone at all. He wanted me in the boot for another 2 weeks, while this was on order. This brace came in 2-3 days, fast shipping, I put it on, laced it up, and took a few steps and almost cried because I finally had the support I needed! It fits even in my pair of TOMS shoes, which were already a little stretched out from wearing them with the wrap on after it happened and I was swollen. I did put it on with my Nikes last night, that have an arch support in them as well, so it cuts down on room to begin with. It fit GREAT! I went out in my yard and did my gardening last night, which is really uneven ground with holes here and there ( I seem to find and step in every ONE) and it was just great! I am to wear it for my every day use, and I WILL BE! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT! I also found the company that shipped it to be one of the more reasonable prices for it.

What we received was a different formula product. We thought we were losing our mind's because we could have sworn we ordered what our container said.When we questioned this with Johnson & Johnson, they ignored us even though we told them my wife was allergic to some of the ingredients in the 'new' formula, and why couldn't we still get the Aloe & Vitamin E formula? Two perfectly reasonable consumer requests (we thought). We were completely stonewalled by Johnson & Johnson. They totally ignored our request as lifelong user's of their products and blew us off like an elephant does a mosquito. Their so-called Customer Service (definitely an oxymoron) people sounded bored and hostile with a 'who cares?' attitude. As if it was a Top Secret project, no one at Johnson & Johnson could or would take the time to explain why the major change to a fantastic product that actually worked.Johnson & Johnson, although a giant old umbrella of many companies, would do well to remember that there is still competition out there, and not to blow off courteous, sincere requests like ours. Ignoring your customers and just hoping they go away will not win you sales, Johnson & Johnson.The actual retail vendor of the product, Pharmapacks.com, was kind enough to call us personally and apologize for the confusion, explaining in detail that Johnson & Johnson unilaterally changed the formula but retained the same UPC bar code. So when you order the one shown on Amazon you get the newer formula loaded, in our opinion, with suspect chemicals and ingredients, and no longer advertising on the front of the container ""With Aloe and Vitamin E."" Pharmapacks deserves high marks for honesty, integrity, and excellent customer service. We highly recommend them as an Amazon vendor.We are very dissapointed that Johnson & Johnson no longer offers the Vitamin E and Aloe formula baby powder, and cannot understand why Johnson & Johnson does not tell their consumer's through advertisements when they change formulas?Believe it or not Johnson & Johnson, some of your customers DO care what is in the products you sell us and we check the labels and packaging for surprise changes!Be careful what you order on Amazon.

I also heard that Duct tape works the same way..(Of course I found this out later) Like to hear if this is true. Apparently you cut a piece to cover the wart for a few days. When the skin cells die you file it down and keep putting the duct tape on until the wart goes away.I'll have to try it if I ever get a wart again.Good Luck! :),health personal care,health care,foot care,149

While we're still having the calibration problem, they haven't touched them in about a month probably.On the good side...when it does work, i love the features and the way it's designed for learning.Also, one other thing...my 1 year old i think likes them better than the older kids. you can't get it away from him!!So, all in all...don't get it!!!

Also a bit disappointing is that the rope on the crane does not reach to the bottom of the buildings where the first level road is located. In order to put boxes in trucks with crane feature you will have to build a road '1 story' up on the buildings which you can do with risers.However my 2 year old loves it and I would recommend it if you have room for it.

36072,B000EZWOQ4,Now Foods Super Epa,A2NSMJVQY0RV9S,18/18,5.0,1329350400,"It's easy to get confused by what fish oil to buy. You're basically looking for two things - quantity of active ingredient and purity. EPA and DHA are the active, helpful component of fish oil and these are the numbers you want to pay attention to. Far too many fish oil supplements only list the amount of oil in the capsule (usually 1000mg or 1200mg) in large print on the front label. This can be deceiving because the active ingredient is generally only 300mg (180mg EPA, 120mg DHA). This 180/120 formulation is indicative of fishoil that whose quality and potency can best be described as ""baseline"". The cheap 180/120 store brand fish oils are also of suspect purity as well. They are probably ""ok"", but most of them are rebranded bargain basement formulations so you're not quite sure what you're getting without doing research.So where does that leave us with this product? Well, NOW Super EPA is a 320/240 potency formulation which means it has twice the active ingredient as most baseline formulas. These capsules are no bigger than standard 1000mg capsules, so it's not like you're swallowing a horse pill either. NOW has a very solid reputation in the supplement industry for potent, high quality supplements. You can trust the purity claims on this product.So here is some math to show you what you're getting for your money. 360mg EPA + 240mg DHA = 600mg active ingredient per softgel. 240 softgels = 144grams active ingredient per bottle. At approximately $23/bottle at the time of this review, that is 16 cent per gram of active ingredient.After doing a fair amount of research, this was the lowest price I could find from a reputable manufacturer.

I was told that the Meleda electric pump was awesome so I purchased it. I tried to pump for over a hour and didn't get one drop out of it. The suction was horrible on it and did nothing for me. I asked the general manager of Babies R Us if I could return it if I had no luck, espically where it was $80. They told me they aren't suppose to return them once opened but they would go ahead and return it for me if it didn't work. After trying it and no luck, I returned it and purchased this pump. Can I say, I LOVE IT! I have had great results and it's so easy to use, and QUIET!! The Meleda electric pump was so loud it sounded like a razor going off! I'm not sure how much milk is normal to get out since everyone is different but on average I am able to get about 4 ozs out in about 15 minutes. I don't think I am a milking machine but I get enough out for my baby. I have noticed that since pumping, my milk has let down alot more and I am able to actually feel it let down now. The only 3 things that I don't care for is 1)The cushion around the funnel for the ""Let down"" effect. It seems to work best for me with out it on. 2) Your milk tends to drip out of the funnel and onto your clothes on occasion. 3)The suction comes loose sometimes and you have to start all over again.

Needless to say it can't handle a child crawling through it without getting all messed up. To say it's flimsy is an understatement.At her birthday party, not one of the 10 kids paid any attention to it (says it all, doesn't it?) until the very end when my daughter and another girl entered - and the tent tipped over immediately.I'm kicking myself for discarding the box because otherwise I would have returned it as fast as I possibly could.

I have to say that it takes me less than 10 minutes to install-- probably closer to 5. Yes, the buckle is a bit confusing, but my sister, parents, and inlaws are all able to buckle it without problems. It's very easy to clean-- I've thrown the cover in the washing maching several times and dry it on low heat. The straps are easy to wash in the sink.

He practically ripped the door apart, so I looked for an alternative. I received my pet doorbell several weeks ago, and was thrilled with the idea that I didn't have to keep repairing the door. The product itself looks exactly the way it does in the picture, but I discovered problems with it right away. I first tried to ring the bell with it on the ground. It didn't ring. I thought it was broken, then I noticed it rang when it wasn't on the ground. So I tested it over and over again to figure out what angle it needed to be at to ring. Then I realized it also wouldn't ring if the receiver wasn't placed in the right spot (relative to the doorbell). I decided to attach it to the door with some nails, and discovered my dog could not press the button with the paw facing up on the door. So I turned the paw over (toes facing the ground), and it wouldn't ring. So I tilted it at an angle using 2 other nails. It seemed to work for a while, but it wasn't consistent. At this point, I really didn't want to return it because my dog had been using it diligently (and the door was no longer getting ripped apart), so I tried testing out the angles once again. I realized it worked if I let the battery hang outside of it's compartment - it seems ridiculous, but it worked (finally). So now it is on my door to the yard, upside down at an angle, held up by 4 nails, with the battery (and the wire) hanging out.

There have been no studies to show if this is an issue topically. Most likely it isn't.""Salicylic acid is used to treat acne, warts and other dermatological problems. There are no studies specifically looking at topical salicylic acid in pregnancy. Oral salicylic acid (aspirin) has not been associated with an increase in malformations if used during the first trimester, but use in late in pregnancy has been associated with bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding (Rumack et al., 1981). The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy are probably not relevant for a topical exposure to salicylic acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical salicylic acid is common in many over-the-counter dermatological agents, and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low teratogenic potential.""This came from fetal-exposure'dot'org / acne'dot'htmlI personally don't think it will be an issue - but you have to balance out your own desire to handle acne (the mental stress) with the physical stress that you may be placing on a child.Again - product is great, does what it needs to and does it with proven medicine.

Unfortuately the only positive to come from this purchase was the knowledge of what I need in a double stroller - all features absent on this model.First of all, and most importantly, neither the 3 yr old nor the 15 mo old are comfortable riding in this and there is no possible way either could fall asleep in this stroller. Even the front seat, the more ""comfortable"" of the two, does not recline worth a darn (which makes sense as the back ""seat"" passenger would be folded in half were one to try). I knew this going into it, however did not apppreciate the importance of having two seats that can accomodate sleepy travellers.The back ""seat"" slides around constantly. There must be a way to keep this still but I've tried every configuration of the 2 snaps that are presumably there to to this and nothing has worked. I spend 80% of my time re-adjusting Big Sister's seat.The back passenger's feet WILL end up getting twisted underneath the stroller at some point. I have a child in the 10th percentile for height and weight and even she cannot avoid this happening.For being un ""ultralight"" this feels remarkably heavy and awkward. You WILL end up making a spectacle of yourself trying to navigate this stroller in tight spaces (ie the pediatrician's waiting room). Prepare to be humiliated.The footrest of the front seat routinely gets stuck in the upright position. Now that little sister is not so little this is a big pain.I have had to stifle many an f-bomb during the process of folding and unfolding this stroller. Fortunately we have a vehicle large enough to haul it whole if (when) I just can't make it collapse. This happens more often than it should. I barely take it out anymore because it's just not worth the trouble.All in all, this ""bargain"" of a double stroller cost me plenty since I now have to replace it with something more appropriate for our needs.

23810,B000FML7SW,BandIT Therapeutic Forearm Band,A3LSFJ32QJZVLR,2/3,3.0,1277856000,"Hoping to get rid of tennis elbow pain, I read quite a few reviews of competing products on Amazon. Due to large number of positive reviews versus other products that do the same thing, I settled on this one. Although I have not worn it long enough yet to experience relief of the inflammation of tennis elbow (couple weeks now), I can say this. Obviously you need to wear it tight enough to restrict interaction of the forearm muscle with the tendon connected to the elbow bone. But in so doing, it does cut off circulation even though it appears that, as a two part brace, it might not do so, where the straps ""only"" are in contact with the arm.When you cinch it down adequately, the straps do compress the forearm flesh and muscle, cutting off circulation, contrary to their marketing claims. So I have had to loosen it up a bit, but when I make a fist and move my hand around to activate the muscle interaction with the tendon, I can tell that it is not restraining muscle activity enough to appear to relieve stress on the tendon. I am judging this by feeling the muscle action between the brace, and the tendon and I can feel it flexing more than it does when I have it tighter and properly restrained.But the most uncomfortable thing about this product, is that the edges of the velcro strap are very thin and thus a bit sharp along the outer edges, beyond the soft part of the velcro itself, where the strap has been ""heat cut"" to prevent unraveling and fraying. Not to the point that they would literally cut you, but certainly uncomfortable over several hours of use. So the real weak point in this product is the velcro strap. If they could figure out a way to get rid of the abrupt and relatively sharp edge, it would enhance comfort in wearing over extended periods.",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,braces,327

If I'm puming after a feeding or something they're fine, but if I'm pumping in place of a feeding, I generally pump about 6 oz which is just enough that the bottles won't hold it all, but also enough that if I try to switch bottles I wind up with two bottles that only have a quarter z or so each in them. It's annoying. And maybe I'm missing something, but it doesn't seem like you can buy the larger collection bottles separately - you either have to get them with a kit, or with a feeding and storage set, either way you're paying for additional parts you don't need. The plusses though are these things come pre-sterilized and the small size has some advantages - topping off a newborn who only needs an ounce or two, or pre-measuring a couple of ounces of breastmilk to mix with cereal, for example.",baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,167

In fact, it was the wrong thing - she meant colored pencils, not paints.Nevertheless, she had a go at it and the results are not half bad. The lightly-textured artboard is a bit thin and tends to curl, you might want to mount it on a stiff substrate before you begin. The paints are good quality acrylics with plenty of pigment and easily cover in one coat. The colors are bright and consistent. Acrylic is a difficult medium, because it dries fast but the advantage is that you can very easily correct edge mistakes. Edge blending can be difficult, but the painting has a pleasing graphic print qualityAcrylic is also relatively thick, and some areas of the painting are very narrow lines, dots etc. The paintbrush supplied with the kit is very thin, but still a tad too wide for some details. Buy a small pack of assorted bruhes and make sure that at least one is narrower than the brush supplied in the kit. For narrow areas, thin the acrylic in a mixing tray with a little water and buid up several coats.You must mix paints to make some of the colors. This can be very difficult to do consistently with small pots of paint. First, identify all the areas that require a mixed color. If there are many such areas, group them into regoins and do one region at a timeMix no more than a few drops from each pot. I recommend a using narrow drinking straw as a pipette to draw up a drop of paint that you can puff into the mixing plate. Mark the straw about 1/4 inch with an indelible marker. Use a clean straw for each color and use your brush to wipe paint off the paint on the the exterior of the straw. That will give you a pretty good 50-50 mix.On the whole, this is a nice little hobby toy for older kids and adults, well made and reasonably priced.",toys games,arts crafts,craft kits,360

I played this version in college and it remains fun for adults as well as children. The ""Mars Edition"" celebrates the exploration on the Red Planet by recent robotic explorers and is educational in its requirement to know the names of moons of the various planets, some facts about them, and stimulates the imagination through pretend exploration. You can't place houses or motels on your ""properties"" in Spaceopoly, but there is financial incentive to require all the moons of a planet, and the tendancy to get ""stuck in orbit"" around a world can make your competitors pay the price if you've been fortunate/smart enough to invest in a certain series or worlds.

Once I received the litterbox, I found out my feeling was right on.I had read some confusing reviews that suggested rubbing oil on the inside, taping and bolting pieces together, etc., but none of that is really necessary. Really, why make something so wonderfully simple into something complicated? The clips keep it closed well and, unless you have a cat with bowel problems or don't like to clean your box daily, it stays quite clean on the inner sides. I have a large Maine Coon kitten who loves to excavate his litter, and he kicked litter from his old box to Kingdom Come. The Omega Paw contains all the litter and dust quite well, and the regular size is plenty big enough to accomodate him. It's truly easy to use, I just roll it over and back again, give it a little tip, and viola! No more scooping!! YAY!!

It's been purchased from granola stores and a Mexican market nearby, all places having the same soap at wildly varying prices. When I found this on Amazon I read comments from varying sources that the soap they ordered didn't smell the same as the soap they'd been buying at brick-and-mortar shops. I don't recall anyone making such comments from this source so I bought a box of a dozen bars, paying a bit more than the cheapest available (which had several reviews about the soapy-smell). It arrived quickly and in sturdy packaging. But when I opened the box it smelled strongly of Dove or Ivory - plainly ""soapy"" instead of the rather strong sandalwood I've always purchased before, which I used to also use to scent my clothes in luggage and in drawers.I can't imagine a factory making this soap with different ingredients from those sold in stores so my only guess about the fragrance shift could be due to this box of soap having been stored near another brand that does smell VERY soap-like.These soaps have now been in a basket in our bathroom for about a week and the soap smell has largely dissipated. We haven't had need to use them yet, so I may add on to this review after we do. I'm hoping that they will smell more of sandalwood and will keep my skin from breaking out like the ones I've been buying do.EDIT THREE WEEKS LATER --> I'll leave my above comments so others who are perplexed by this fragrance shift will know about it. HOWEVER, the soaps I bought and left out in the open in a basket now all smell of sandalwood, exactly as this brand of soap has always smelled when I purchased it at a brick-and-mortar store.

They were great for mixing powder formula right in the bottle and very easy to clean because of the wide opening. The silicon nipples hold up well after many uses and even hold up well in the dishwasher. They also cut down on gas and spit ups because they are air tight. They are horrible because they leak!! Sometimes the lid would go on just right and I would have no problems and other times it would take me 10 tries before getting the lid on just right. I first thought I must be doing something wrong but after talking to several other mothers I found they were all having the same problem. This is very frustrating when you have a screaming crying baby who is waiting for her bottle! I am now expecting twins and will not be using Avent this time!

I do wish it was a little taller though, as the big 35-40 pound bags of dog food are a bit difficult to squish down in this when they are new. They will fit, but it is difficult to fully close the container with a brand new bag and I sometimes wonder if I am going to put too much stress on the lid or the seal by forcing it down in order to latch it, although it has not appeared to do any damage yet. Even with this minor issue, I am actually planning to buy a second one now, since my two dogs now eat different foods for health reasons. I have not had any issues with this item so far and although I don't absolutely love it, it does what it says and gets the job done.

He likes playing with the front and the lights/music he enjoys a lot but wants to climb up the front too but due to it's lightness it would just tip over on him if I wasn't there to prevent the thing tipping over. He cannot even pull himself up from the back because again too light, tips.

The sauce is good on Bar-B-Que meat, but should be spread on when the meat is almost done. If it's put on too early, the sugar will burn and you'll end up with a charred mess. It can also be used as is, poured over a block of cream cheese and served as an appetizer with crackers.

After test driving both in the house, I returned the Tote-A-Tot as it felt less secure than the Traveling Toddler, mainly because of the use of plastic buckles on the Tote-A-Tot versus metal rings on the Traveling Toddler.I was not disappointed with my decision at all. The Traveling Toddler was amazing! It allowed me to take my 17-month-old daughter, her Britax Roundabout carseat, a backpack and rolling suitcase through the airport alone and I even had a free hand. Yes, you will have to detach the carseat from the suitcase to get through security and then to get on the plane, but it only took a few minutes to hook back together -- two clicks if you leave the Traveling Toddler attached to the tether strap of the carseat. I would put my child in her car seat, then attach the carseat to the suitcase to avoid the issue of a wandering toddler while hooking things back up. The flight attendants were extremely helpful in carrying the carseat and finding a spot for my luggage in the overhead bin while I carried my child to her seat. I went through security without help.It was relatively easy to push -- a few times I had to get some momentum to get over a door threshold, but there are no signs of wear or marks on the strap, the carseat or my luggage. This is the cheapest option out there and unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars on the carseat / stroller combo, this is the way to go. I had so many people stop and ask me about it.The best part -- the novelty of it made my daughter want to keep climbing in her carseat for rides!

17499,B000NIAZNG,MiraLAX laxative powder,A14EP5T0OZ40QG,5/6,5.0,1235260800,"Severe Pain with Intestinal Gas in three and half year old boy.Suddenly my young son double-over onto the floor in agonizing pain until he was able pass gas. This has never happened before. Thinking it will pass in a day or two as it could be a stomach virus I remained cautious. Since everything else was normal, no vomiting, diareaha, fever; a good appetite and energy level, it seemed odd that all the acute pain was isolated to his large intestines. After a day of this I used Infants MYLICON to help relieve gas (as recommended by my family doctor), but that didn't help. The pain continued through 2 days and 2 nights. The frequency increased to every 15 minutes. Each episode he would curl into a ball in terrible pain until he could pass the gas, then everything was okay. He continued to have bowl movements, sometimes twice a day. Thinking back, however, his stool was long, narrow and soft. Nothing that would indicated ACUTE CONSTIPATION. But, maybe the narrowness of the stools could've been an indicator. After 2 days of these unusual episodes I decided something had to be done. I was prepared to take him everywhere until I got answer. I took him to a local immediate care office where a nurse practioner (requested a doctor) (waited 2 hours) initially said to just watch it. After she witnessed an episode she got more concerned. I had already made up my mind that we were going to the Emergency Room, which is where I should have gone in the first place. The ER doctor took an x-ray of his abdomen and it revealed severe fecal back-up on one side of his intestines. So, how could this have happened. It was obvious this happened over time. The fecal backup began when potty training started in July (its now February). He would pee in the potty and toilet with no problem. Up until mid December he would not poop in the toilet or potty, just in a diaper. This is when he would hold back the poop. Before potty training he would poop everyday or twice day. After potty training he pooped every other day or 3rd day. In mid December he accidently pooped in the toilet and had a light bulb moment and from then on no problem with pooping anywhere - even outside in the yard. But, the damage was done. With 5 months of holding back his bowl movements, his intestines became increasing clogged to the point where narrow poop was coming out and was having severe gas pain. The ER doctor prescribed an over the counter MIRALAX ( 1 cap full in 8 oz. of juice once a day). The MIRALAX began working within 3 hours and has been working into the 2nd day. He is having bowl movements about every hour - some watery, some like pudding. Now he has some pain when the poop is moving out,but its not the kind of pain where he is doubling over to the floor crying. We've made significant progress. The ER doctor recommended he stay on MIRALAX for several weeks to maybe even several months until he gets good, high quality poops going on a regular basis. He needs to be thoroughly cleaned out -- its been building for so long.Lesson 1",health personal care,health care,digestion nausea,555

It is good enough to be a cheap item that you keep in your car, but I'd never have considered this to replace my Medela Pump In Style Advanced.The reason why the dual pump gets lower reviews than the single is that the second pump is daisy-chained off the first -- so you're getting the same amount of suction for both breasts (you can use only the one at a time, though). Not conducive to pumping more than a couple of ounces, if you're lucky. The four-ounce capacity of the bottles is rather optimistic, in my opinion, especially since the entire unit can run on 3 AA batteries.So, if you're stuck somewhere and desperately need to pump off a bit of excess, you can use this unit.

Mine works fine and the kids slam it pretty hard.I usually have 3 girls and 1 boy here and everyone plays pretty well in there - they love it and use it as a playhouse for tea-parties and hide and seek and just general play. One night I had 3 boys and 1 girl and I was quite surprised the thing didnt tear in 2. They flew around the house at 100 miles an hour terrorizing everything and flipped it over a bunch of times and I would have sworn a couple times it was gonna rip apart but it actually held together. I do have a couple tears now in the walls from when they were really thrashing on it but after reading previous reviews I was kind of expecting that. They are not enough for me to worry about and are not on the seems so no metal is exposed.

As such, we only use it on the weekends when I am home.2. It takes a long time to dry out (set up running with the fan) - can take several hours. It is not something you can put away quickly after your kids play. Each time the slide has gone away somewhat wet...and that leads me to worry about degrading the durability.3. Lots of concerns on this site about durability. I am only 4 uses in and I can already tell that this will be a toy that will require continual maintenance/repair. I have already seen a couple small seam splits. These I have patched by simply using superglue on the seam. Larger rips will need to be patched - and catastrophic tears will need to be sewn with fishing line and sealed with seam sealer (none yet - but I am expecting them).4. This toy requires supervision. My son already fell about 4 feet onto his head from climbing on the ouside of the ladder. So - create and ENFORCE strict rules. Also - my boys (4 & 6) like to wrestle and a favorite spot seems to be at the top of the slide. The danger of a fall due to this behavior is high. I cannot leave them alone on the slide for even a short period of time....in fact...I can't even multi-task while they are playing. Maybe your kids are less nutty than mine.Finally - I hope it lasts at least two summers. If I can get two summers worth of use out of it then i will buy the bigger more expensive slide next time because it is so much fun....if it breaks down before that then I will chalk it up as an expensive lesson learned about Banzai products.",toys games,sports outdoor play,pools water fun,320

I'm right there with the other reviewer who said it was &quot;not a leak but a pour&quot; I always double and triple check the nipple and ring before giving my baby the bottle and about 50% of the time either right away or halfway through a bottle it will just start to pour out all over the baby and me. As a mom of 4 it can't be chalked up to inexperience I definitely know what I'm doing. So to those moms who haven't had any problems yet good luck to you, but I just wanted to warn others it might not but it can happen. Just imagine what it's like when you have to take the bottle away from your screaming hungry baby so you can clean up the mess and fiddle with the cap in he middle of a feeding (believe me it is not pleasant!)",baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,265

It took a couple of minutes to assemble and it was ready to go. Plus it was affordable, very sturdy, easy to manuver, and get down stair. It is such a blessing to have one of these. My Westie is a bit overwieght (28lbs) and he loves it. He has room to stretch out, sit up. I can see him at all times because of the mesh veiwer. I can take him on the train, in stores, where ever I want, because he's secured and enclosed. I get alot of compliments and some strange looks because it looks just like a baby stroller, even better than some of them I was told. ****The only thing I would say bad about it is that the mesh cover has a toxic smell to it....BUT once I took it outside a couple of times it did air out, and the smell is gone. ****Also to make it more comfortable I did place a cusion lining inside.

The salmon flavor in them appears to be quite strong, strong enough that it brings all 4 of my cats running from wherever they are in the house whenever I open the packet; and strong enough to overcome the taste of the pill. After I give Kushka her pill pocket, I immediately start handing out salmon flavor Wicker Lickens treats to my other 3 cats, including 4 or 5 of them to Kushka. The treats for my other cats are so not to show favoritism, but they still think Kushka is getting the best treat (but since other treats are only around a dollar a package, the pill pockets are only for pills). I do really love the pill pockets, for Kushka has been a real terror to pill, even when I used a piller; beside scathing and fighting me, she also bit, and not friendly bites either, but bleeding puncher wounds (this from a normally very passive, affectionate Himalayan). I had never had to give her a pill before she was diagnosed with CRF 2 months ago, she had never been sick before in all 12 years of her life.

This blockage was difficult, if not impossible, to remedy. While the mop head is large and easily maneuverable on an open floor, it is difficult to use the mop to clean tight spaces and narrow areas. In addition, the head flops around too easily, making it difficult to use on elevated or sloped surfaces. After not being able to fix the jet blockage, I ended up emptying the cleaning solution into a spray bottle and using the mop with the pads only, spraying surfaces that needed to be cleaned from the bottle. The 3/4"" wide X 7"" long scrubbing pad is attached using a tiny sliver of velcro, which allows the pad to come off all the time - difficult to use as a scrubber on those difficult to clean, dried-on dirt areas. I'll use it until I run out of pads, then go back to the Swiffer Sweeper with Wet Mopping pads I used to use before shelling out $35+ for the WetJet, pads and extra solution. I want to add that the cleaning solution that comes with the Wet Jet IS very effective - they could probably market this product all by itself.

Every day now she prepares us wonderful foods such as strawberry cake and boiled pizza! The kitchen fits into a fairly compact area, but includes a lot of different features - there's everything you'd find in a real kitchen except maybe a dishwasher. It's attractive, the plastic that it is made out of is very solid and stands up well to everyday use, as well as all-out invasions of friends and cousins. Two or three children can easily use this kitchen at a time. It looks nice, and has a TON of storage space for food and dishes. The sound effects are fun, loud enough, but do not last long enough to become annoying. One of my daughter's favorite features is the over the sink light - which has an automatic shutoff, Mom and Dad!With a power screwdriver, it was very easy to set up by myself (I had to get creative at one point to hold some pieces together) in about an hour, although it may have taken me longer as I was watching TV at the time so it may take less time for most. The directions are easy to follow, and you never have to worry which screw to use where as they are printed, to scale, on the directions when you need to use them - just hold the screws up to the page.There are only a couple of drawbacks to the kitchen. First, there aren't many accessories that come with this. The food items are good quality, but there aren't many. There are plenty of pots and pans, the other dishes are a bit sparse (2 place settings only). The kitchen is so much fun, however, that this is forgivable. Less forgivable however was the fact that the kitchen arrived without the bag containing the instructions for assembly, decals, and decorative back plate. Apparently missing parts are not an altogether rare ocurrance with Step 2 products. The instructions were available online, so I was able to put the kitchen together in time for my daughter's birthday, but it did not look very nice without the decals. To Step 2's credit, it took just a very brief and cordial phone call for them to send out the missing items. While they did not arrive in time for my daughter's birthday, they did come in less than a week, and at their expense.Had it not been for the missing items, it would easily be a five star toy!",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play,423

The first couple of shaves did irritate my neck area, but after a few days that was not an issue anymore. My only real fault with the system is when you clean the razor on the self-cleaning base it is pretty loud. Also the fan that is used to dry the razor runs for hours and is audible in adjacent rooms.

After taking ProFibe for two weeks, my cholesterol went down to 190 and now hovers around 180. Since ProFibe is a food (made from citrus fiber and other natural ingredients), it regulates cholesterol the way nature intended it to be regulated. Unlike cholesterol drugs, ProFibe will not destroy your liver.My favorite way to take ProFibe is to mix one level teaspoon with a high protein chocolate shake (Muscle Milk, Premier Protein, etc) three to four times a day.

I would like to point out that this is a preventative measure not a cure. The existing cyst took the regular time to heal. I would like to also add an added bonus effect that I was not aware of until recently. My eyelashes have doubled in length!! After some research I have found that this is a property of B vitamin complexes, this wasn't my goal at time of purchase but was pleasantly surprised when I noticed my longer lashes in the mirror.

I'm generally a tampon user but when I started trying to get pregnant my acupuncturist suggested I stop using tampons because they disrupted blood flow. So it was back to pads after pretty much never using them before. I was immediately struck by how uncomfortable the store bought pads for heavy flow were; the plastic kept sticking to my skin and I felt like I was constantly readjusting them through my clothes. It was for that reason, more than trying to help the environment, that I looked into cloth pads. I have to say, they are great. They might seem a little bulky at first glance, but they are so soft on the skit and frankly I find them very comfortable. Unfortunately I started using them after my first pregnancy (which was ectopic and had to be terminated) was ""resolving"" and my flow was a lot heavier than usual. These pads had no problem keeping up. What surprised me the most was how easy and completely they cleaned up. Even after a heavy day, I could get them completely clean with just cold water and hand soap in the sink. They come with removable padding, but I think you could even take that out unless your flow was very heavy and you knew you couldn't change for a day.

The lowest setting is basically useless, and the second setting was pretty wimpy too. We stuck to the upper three speeds, though, and it worked well.

I used to sell high-end supplements when I was 18, and I quit the ""top"" company as soon as I learned about Life Force. Life Force is rated top five in the supposedly neutral Comparative Guide to Nutritional Supplements, although I believe the rating was skewed towards that company I used to work for. In either case, Life Force was just as good as the number one supplement I used to sell, and it was one-third the cost. This is by far the highest quality, lowest price multi-vitamin in the world, and you owe it to yourself to take this above any other supplements.I follow ABC bodybuilding's article on the Window of Opportunity.Please keep in mind that it is a guide, not a dogma. Do what feels right and what works for you.The Window of Opportunity is a post-workout shake that I used when I put on over 30 pounds of muscle within 3 months. My bench went from 215 pounds to 450, body fat from 7% to 3%, and mile time from 6 minutes to 5. It works.Here are the quick basics, although you definitely must read the article yourself.After the work out, you should consume .22 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight and 5 grams of carbohydrate (half dextrose, half maltodextrin) per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for bulking, or 2.5 grams of carbohydrate (half dextrose, half maltodextrin) per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for cutting.You should also consume 5-10 grams of creatine, 5-10 grams of glutamine, and a multi-anti-oxidant formula. All this must be done over a 45-60 minute period.The 45-60 minute sequence is vital:Step One:* Blend 1/3 protein (experiment to find the exact number for you), 1/3 dextrose (simple sugar), and 1/3 maltodextrin (complex sugar) with enough water (water should be at least 92% of the total mixture). Add 500 mg of sodium per liter of water used.* Shake the ingredients well. Put creatine powder in your mouth (5-10 grams when starting, 2.5-5 grams once body is saturated with creatine) and drink the shake to wash the creatine down. It is better to do this than to mix the creatine in water, as that makes creatine lose its potency.* Drink one half of the shake within 5 minutes of working out. After this 5 minutes, allow an additional 10-15 minutes for the solution to settle in your stomach.Step 2:* After the solution has dissolved in your stomach for 10-15 minutes, consume 5-10 grams of Glutamine and your multi-vitamin (Life Force) with one gulp of the shake.* Continue to drink the remaining half of the shake for the following 30-45 minute period.* It is vital to drink small sips of your shake for the entire 30-45 minute period. This allows for maximum absorption rate of the nutrients into your body.Step 3:* Take fish oil with a meal, preferably at breakfast.* Take ZMA on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before you go to sleep.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,503

Even if you don't love it (which, based on our experience it not likely) you're only out a negligible amount of money.Now on to the review...I bought this for my wife recently after trying a few dildos with her in the past. She is very picky when it comes to toys and has complained about texture/rigidity and size. I read and watched countless reviews on this toy on Amazon and other sites and nearly all said it was HUGE but very lifelike and most were very favorable. I went ahead and ordered it when I found it on Amazon for this price.We agree on both descriptions of size and feel. While the toy is big, very BIG, it's incredibly lifelike and the head is very soft for comfortable penetration. This has been a complaint by my wife in the past - others we've tried have huge heads (unrealistically so) and/or have been so hard that they weren't pleasurable to use at all. The size is part of the fun part...it takes a good amount of lube and going slowly at first, but she'll be used to it in mere seconds. The shaft is somewhat soft/pliable on the outside, but firm at the core, just like the real thing. The outer layer moves slightly as well, creating a more realistic effect. We have yet to use the suction cup with her for long, so I will withhold comment on this, though it seems you have to adjust it to get it just right to stay put.When my wife first saw this thing after taking it out of the package, she thought there was no way she would enjoy it. However, after the first use, which was more fun than we imagined, she told me she was embarrassed at how much she likes this thing. Guys, that right there should tell you to buy it now for your significant others. Yes, it's bigger than you.

When we listen to music he often shakes and clacks them together to the music.-Both sides come off easily but not too easily. If I take one side off he puts the shapes in and dump them out or with both sides off it is like a tube for rolling around and various other games. If I put all of the shapes in and close both sides he rolls it around and shakes it in both directions. Occasionally a shape will find its way out through its own hole but they dont all come flying out and the sides stay in tact.-The holes are just right, easy enough to fit the shapes so he can have some success and ""get"" the game.If you are looking for a good non-electronic learning toy I highly recommend this one!",toys games,baby toddler toys,shape sorters,243

I asked my private Dr. about the supplement, and he said that this supplement has some anti-depressent qualities. While not being clinically depressed or anything it still made me feel less stress, and more at ease with myself ! The cost isn't much, and in my opinion is well worth the small amount it costs.

One night after 4 beers in 2 hours, and the recommended 20 minute waiting period afterwards, I blew a .14. Last weekend at the end of the night I blew a .33 and was not in driving shape, but far from blacked out. My friend that same night (all following the 20 minute delay periods as well) blew a .37. As a 105lb girl I am pretty sure she wasn't anywhere near that considering we were having a conversation and the instruction manual said she should be in a deep coma and at .40 she should be dead.On the other side it is very consistent. I blow, and wait 2 minutes, nearly identical everytime. I guess you just need to know what real number corresponds to what they are telling you.

30365,B00023D368,"PetSafe Deluxe Bark Control Collar, PDBC-300",A1FWYMLD8U9SDE,4/4,3.0,1308873600,"It's not perfect. My long-haired collie still barks but it's certainly better with the collar than without. It also seems to work better when she has a summer hair cut as the metal probes can reach her skin more easily.The other drawback of this collar is that the on/off/setting button is ANNOYING. Older models had a dial you could turn. On this model, you push and hold a little button for 2-3 seconds, let go, and the setting changes. For example, to change from correction level 1 to 2, you have to press and hold the button for 2-3 sec, then let go. If you want correction level 3, you have to do it again. After correction level 3, pressing the button and releasing takes you to Test mode. Then you can press it again to turn it off. Cycling through all of these settings is slow and frustrating, especially since you might release the button too soon (setting doesn't change) or you might hold it in too long.TIP:I have discovered a trick that I'm not sure is explained in the instructions. You can avoid cycling through all of these levels if e.g., your dog always needs correction level 3. When you're ready to turn the collar off, press and keep holding the button until you see if flash green, and then red (do NOT let go after it flashes green). When it flashes red, the unit is off. To turn it back on, press the button twice, and it will automatically take you back to the level you used last. [If I hadn't discovered this 'feature' of the collar, I think I would have given up on it a long time ago.]OVERALL:I would still buy this collar. I trust the brand in terms of my pet's safety. I just wish it were more effective at curbing the barking and that it weren't so annoying to use.",pet supplies,dogs,collars,317

I've found that it takes three to induce real drowsiness. On the other hand, two are very effective for stopping my brain from its tendency to keep running like a hamster in an exercise wheel. When the wheel slows down, I can usually fall asleep. The sleep is restful and there is no residual groggyness the next day.I also use two tablets when I'm upset or angry about something that happened during the day. It just helps me relax without the downsides of alcohol or other alternatives. Usually, in those cases, if I'm tired, I can then fall asleep naturally.I've used it in combination with melatonin and other mild sleepaids when I know I need to sleep; I'm tense; and I'm just not drowsy. I used in on a transoceanic flight just to help me relax and rest.For me, the bottom line is that Calms Forte won't simply knock me out.

I had bought my usual Obsession. I work in and with construction workers all day, so a light spray is all I ever use. The young woman at the cologne counter asked me if I had tried Givenchy PI. I'm not trying to be some highly cultured guy here, ""Tried it? I can't even say that"". She handed me a whole bag of the samples of Givenchy PI and told me to try it out since it reminded some of a lighter, more masculine Obsession.I thought nothing of it, but as soon as I tried it, I loved it. My wife at the time, I was only about 24, she hated it! Oh, it wasn't because she really hated it, it was because she was a jealous type.Yeah, so fast forward, divorce, and I swear to you all, she stole one of my shirts and sprayed Givenchy PI all over it! Over the next few years, we went back to being at least friends and about once a week she would stop by and ask me to spray the shirt.Sure that doesn't say much for me, she let me go, but not the smell. Needless to say, I moved on, got married to a different lady, and my ex no longer comes by to get me to spray the shirt for her. I could make this a review riddle and ask if you know why, but since I am really trying to tell how great this cologne is, I will tie up the loose strings.I married the woman from the cologne counter that gave me the Givenchy samples, and my ex, being a friend by then, came to our wedding, where my new wife, the cologne saleswoman, gave her a box of Givenchy samples so she would stop coming by to have me spray the shirt! Oh and yeah, this stuff is much better fresh. My ex says the samples don't smell near as good as the bottle I have. Of course, the samples were old and that is how my current wife was able to give her a whole box of the samples.Moral of the story, this cologne is loved by women. To this day, I am asked at grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants, what I am wearing by women and men always ask, ""Hey man, come here, what kind of cologne is that? Smells good"" you know, all secretive like, like they don't want any other men hearing me tell them the name of it.The other moral is current wife still will spite ex-wife, even if it just outdated Givenchy samples!One of my yearly presents from my wife during the holidays usually and one that I would recommend to all men for themselves or to women to buy for their man.

(With all of the drop-side crib recalls these days, I'm so glad my crib isn't one after all!) The crib is very sturdy. The only problem is that the wood is VERY soft and marks up easily. I knew this when I bought it because it was stated in other reviews, but I didn't act in time to protect the sides from a gnawing teether. If you buy this crib, I recommend putting some kind of rail cover over all the sides as soon as your baby can stand. I have a gummi rail, but it doesn't stick well in parts because the wood is so scraped up.

With all my newfound knowledge about cologne history, perspective, and opinions, I used these colognes to give an informative speech this evening in my public speaking course, complete with all the bottles present. I sprayed CURVE onto myself when it arrived, and now I am comparing all of the new scents to my favorites so far, HUGO and CANDIES. My impression was that it was more serious than Hugo, had a sweetish overtone combined with musk, and then there was sort of a greenish bitter forest type scent to it that I wasn't crazy about. I think I may have been dissappointed at first, but that soon changed. After about fifteen minutes the smell got to be really good and the elements I hadn't liked were gone or had matured into subtle forms that went well together.After the speech I allowed the class to sample all of the colognes, and Curve was commented on the most, followed by Drakkar, then Hugo. All of the women liked it and seemed to have great associations with it, and for that I have to ensure that it gets the full 5 stars. I continue to wear it now later this same evening and it has quite grown on me.If you only bought Curve as your main cologne, you'd be quite alright.

Neither of these were in tune with my first experience with the 7180XL, as far as initial charging, and what the green charging light and red low battery light were doing.The manual calls for a 12 hour initial charge before using the shaver. When fully charged, the green light is supposed to blink. Well, on my initial charge, the light started blinking after 30 minutes. I did continue the charge for 12 hours anyway, the green light blinking the whole time.I called Norelco support, and was informed the manual was not correct, and that I had not damaged my shaver by completing the 12 hour charge. But no further explanation.Then I started using the shaver, and after just 2 shaves, the red low battery light came on. I went back to the Norelco website, and found a page on charging that said if the shaver did that, you should use it until the motor stops. They omit the obvious next step of charging it in these instructions, but say you will have no problem with the red light coming on too soon after following their directions.Well, I have done that, and it remains to be seen if my new Norelco will eventually sort itself out and work right.I must say I have my doubts after this initial experience, that it will last as long as my 7 year old model 5841XL did.

Just to let ya' know, her arms are PERMENANTLY bent in the posistion they are in. You can still move them up n' down, but no bending them.

My back does hurt after 3 or 4 miles but with a backpack on to counterbalance me, I have no pain. I also only gave it four stars because the head support doesn't fold down very well when my 10 wk old faces out.

First of all - my comments here are based on a year's worth of experience with the Champ in use. I've done everything from change bags on a daily basis to scrubbing it frequently with bleach, and spraying it down with Lysol. I've done everything I can think of to not waste my investment in this product. Nothing contains the odors it started to let out after about the 5th month. I phoned the Diaper Champ customer service to ask what to do about the smell, the girl on the line told me the smell is normal as about every 6 months the seals on the unit need to be replaced. Nowhere in the instructions I received did it say that this would be necessary. Furthermore, DC Customer Service said that I'd have to phone in every 6 months to have them send out my free replacement kit to maintain my unit. Incorrectly wrapping your diapers before putting them in the unit can hasten this process as a loose tape can wreak havoc with the foam seals. After a year of putting up with the smell and changing out seals with no success (the smell just got worse with time and now seems to be in the plastic itself), I'm retiring the Diaper Champ and buying a Neat! system with my fingers crossed for better luck.",baby products,diapering,diaper pails refills,242

For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE.

The game was in excellent condition for being a few years old, probably because it was played once then stowed away because it was too difficult to figure out.

My wife read the books and didn't remember any characters with that name. Couldn't they have chosen someone else?After an hour, we (two very intelligent people) were still batting our eyes at the instructions, trying to figure it out as we played along. My wife wanted to quit after us not having even begun, but I ended up convincing her to play along, and we did for a total of two and a half hours, while continuing to figure the game out, missing steps and constantly reminding each other to remember common steps. The worst part was the huge let down at the end, when we were supposed to win. Apparently we were fortunate enough to make it to the end of the game board with only two of us playing. Anyhow, the directions were so terrible that we had won and didn't know it, because there were so many rules to follow and steps to take that we didn't know if there was something more we had to do in order to win.

The bathroom and kitchen sets, which have been updated, had the most play value, and the bunkbed was great, too. The houses are expensive, and cramped, but an old or cheap bookcase that can be wallpapered or painted makes a great house/storage unit.

I was afraid that I might not be able to take it out if I cut off the stem completely but you can push the cup down using your vaginal muscles (push about 3-4 times until you can grab the bottom of the cup with your index finger and your thumb) and there really shouldn't be much problem removing it.. but the key is to relax and not feel scared that you might not be able to get it out. Don't worry, you can get it out! I used this video for help. [...]Now that there's no stem peaking out, it stays in and it does not leak at all, although I still have to use a panti liner. Anyway this product is amazing that it will save me so much money on buying tampons and pads.

Although I personally consider this product to be soap, officially it's a ""beauty bar"" substitute for soap in that it contains a good amount of moisturizing cream. Soap doesn't always moisturize; and so Dove tries to set their product apart from soap when they advertise the moisturizing abilities of their product. Rest assured, however, that you will find this item where the rest of the soap is stocked in your grocery store.These bars of soap are also completely unscented which makes them all the better for those of us with sensitive skin. They are also hypo-allergenic. The manufacturer also indicates on the package that these Dove unscented beauty bars for sensitive skin are dermatologist tested. Great!The bars of soap are rather large but they don't slip out of your hands too easily; the shape of the bar helps you hold onto it. The Dove unscented ""beauty bars"" do seem to truly help moisturize my skin when I use them to take a shower or wash my hands.Dove is a little more expensive than other soaps but many people like me swear it's worth it. My best friend uses Dove religiously and he says it helps his sensitive skin a great deal. One reviewer wrote elsewhere that Dove soap is not particularly useful for acne; but I cannot personally comment on this because I do not have acne or other types of skin breakouts. I did notice, however, that two other people commented on that review and they stated that Dove soap did help them with their acne. If any skin condition is a concern for you, talk with your doctor or pharmacist before using this product.If you have any other questions about this product, Dove offers its customers (and potential customers) both a website and a toll free number.

They were easy to apply (I glued them on while she was napping) and she didn't even notice they were there when she woke up. They were very effective for preventing scratching. HOWEVER, we have many rugs with looped carpeting and she gets her nail caps caught in the loops several times every day. I was only able to work her claw out two times.....the other 20+ times I have had to cut the yarn in the rug to get her out. Just a few minutes ago she got caught (for the second time in less than one minute) and she started rolling around and got her arm twisted behind her in a way that makes me wonder how she may have injured herself had I not been right there to help her.

The little pieces of rock come flying out everywhere. Glasses are a must!..for you as well.3. DON'T DIG OVER CARPET. The rock kind of makes a mess....not a big mess, but it's much easier to sweep up from a hard floor than a carpet.4. LET YOUR CHILD DO IT!!!

The morning following my first application proved the gentle efficacy of the product.I continued taking Colon-X capsules till two days before my scheduled colonoscopy when I began the physician's orders for other products.For those of you facing this procedure, I recommend your ""easing"" into it by starting these capsules, then following your physician's orders. The dreaded day before the colonoscopy will become less dreaded and easier on your system if you do. I hope you have the successful results I did.____FOLLOWUP COMMENT:My colonoscopy was so easy because of the efficacy of this plus other preps the physician ordered. In fact, I asked for a minimum of anesthesia and actually watched the last half of the procedure on the screen. Because I was not heavily sedated, I joked with the staff I was ready for a game of tennis--and, actually, I think I could have played a set right then.

We went to NYC and found it nearly impossible to find restaurants with high chairs or booster seats with straps. I am thinking of taking these 2 seats with me, so we can eat at any restaurant. I found my kids using the high chairs to rest their heads on the back rest. With this they are sitting up straight which I think is better for them. Using it is very easy. There is a strap that goes under the chair you will use it with and can be tightened. There is also a strap that goes around the back and can be tightened. I have tried moving the booster seats while they are tied down and they are very secure. Once in a while I would take the high chairs to my relative's house, since it is not easy feeding them on our laps or running after them. It was such a chore to load up the high chairs. With these booster seats I have them unstrapped and loaded in less than 2 minutes. Also, your relatives do not look at you so strange carrying this around compared to a full high chair. We do not use the trays since the kids are big enough that they are table height when they sit on the booster.

I was clean for 2 weeks prior to using it. I drank a good amount of water during the week leading up to the test.On the day of the test, I gave myself a four hour time frame. Eat normally! I had my usual cup of coffee, ate a bowl of cereal, then drank a bottle of water before drinking the Ready Clean. After you drink it, refill the bottle (as the instructions tell you) with water and drink it. After that, do not consume more than 16oz of water every two hours. Wait ONE HOUR before taking the test. Ready Clean is most effective 1-2 hours after consumption. So if you drink it at 11am, you'll want to take the test anywhere between 12-2. If you take it before or after the time frame, you're risking failing the test. I drank a Gatorade (be sure you pee at least 5 times before taking the test to flush your system) and then took the test and everything went great.I wanted to put a really thorough review on here because I was horribly nervous about using this product.

25538,B000Q7AH3W,Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball,A1EMRE3MRDG5FW,0/0,2.0,1287792000,"We purchased this product based on the highly positive reviews we read here on Amazon. Our dog, Oscar, loves frozen Kongs, the Busy Body Squirrel, as well as the Bob-a-Lot and Kong Wobbler (basically anything that makes him work a little to get his food). However, he did not like this toy at all.We use the other toys to get him to slow down as he eats. Oscar is a 9-month old Laborador Retriever, and since he was about 4 months old he has scarfed his food down in seconds (only to become bored very quickly after). So very early we began to explore ways to make feeding time fun and a little challenging for him.We filled the Tricky Treat Ball with his food, just like the other treats, and put it on the floor and waited for him to seize upon the new toy (like he does with other treat systems). Instead he pushed it and then ignored it.The problem is that the food/treats do not reliably dispense-- it is basically a ball with a very long cylindrical piece attached to the entry (like a long tube that goes down into the ball). The dog really would have to turn this over and over and over to get treats to roll out. It has no weighting to it (like the Kong Wobbler or the Bob-a-Lot), so it just kind of randomly works. I think it makes it less of a 'puzzle' to figure out as the dispensing pattern is infrequent and random (and most often actions result in 'no treat' delivered).Hope this review helps. I do see a lot of dogs like this, so it may have to do with how your dog is used to 'working' for treats.Woof!",pet supplies,dogs,toys,290

I like that its not all music and electronics like the LeapFrog. My sister has a little girl whos one year old, the leapfrog is too small, but her daughter fits well in mine! It makes too much noise and there are no toys that actually are just rattles, too anoying and pricey. The B.E has a balanced mix...One of the other reviewers mentioned all the toys, but the little, what we call, ""game board"" makes music. It has a duck, lion, dog, cat, and a cow on it. They say the names and make the animal noise, but it also says the color on the button, educational and fun. The other electronic toy is the book. It sort of reads, makes music, and the twins like it... but thats all the electronics!Amazingly they really enjoy that green pupet, we see him in the ever so popular B.E videos, and we own an actual pupet of him! The other toys are great teethers and they are super fun to play with.The saucer spins easily, and my twins are now masters! I see my daughter just spining around, having the time of her life just spining! Its also funny to put the pegs up to it rocks, they love that! Its easy to adjust heights, and the twins have one more setting to go!! The seat is the perfect size and any toddler/baby could fit. I also put cheerios, fruits, whatever on the trays and the toys have never stoped working and the kids have a blast!I really love this B.E product, the U.S.C is nice, but its not as fun as the B.E!!

25729,B00000JKWY,iMAgiNiff Game,A2BWSPQ0SE41KF,0/0,5.0,1288742400,"Imaginiff can be a real funny game that gives you an opportunity to learn things about your friends and family that you never would've guessed. Players take their turn reading questions off a card that are directed either toward themselves or toward one of their opponents. The questions ask things like ""Imagine if so-and-so were a cartoon character. Which would he be?"" or ""Imagine if so-and-so wrote a book. What genre would it be?"" The players are then given 6 answers to choose from (numbered 1-6). Using the cards in their hands (numbered 1-6), the players have to guess which answer they think is the most accurate about that particular person. The ""correct answer"" is the one that the most players choose, and the players who choose that answer get to move their pieces on the board. The first player to reach the space in the middle of the board is the winner.I really enjoy playing this game. Not only do you get to see what your friends think about you, but your friends also get to see what you and everyone else playing the game thinks about them. There are a wide variety of questions that can lead to some hilarious responses from your opponents. This is a great game to play with your family and friends, and it can be played with as many as 8 players. This is one of those games where the more people you have playing, the more entertaining it can be because everyone is involved in the action on every turn. Ultimately what Imaginiff comes down to is how well you know your opponents, because the more things you know about them the more likely you are to win the game. I highly recommend it to everyone. It's fun, it's easy to understand, and there's never a dull moment that arises at any point during the game.",toys games,games,board games,314

I think this game was not available in the USA back then, so it used to cost more because it was imported from another country. So I think this price is very reasonable. To make this game even more fun, have a large ladle on the table right next to this game and once the pirate pops up, the person who made the pirate poped up reach for the ladle and try to catch him before he lands. Since you don't know when the pirate pops up, you need to move fast enough to catch him. If you catch him with the ladle, you win. If he lands on the table, you lose.

You can change the settings to lots of different combinations to get different voices. My six year old nephew had a blast with this, but the funny thing is, the adults enjoyed it just as much as the kids! It has one deep, Darth Vader-type voice, so of course all the adults wanted to say ""Luke, I am your father!"" into it, LOL.

She was driving me insane, and I was worried that she would turn us into the pariahs of the neighborhood.When the Spray Sense Collar arrived, I immediately put it to use. It does take several minutes to assemble--the collar, anti-bark unit, and citronella spray are packaged separately and you have to put the unit onto the collar. The directions are relatively clear, but if you are less than mechanically inclined, as I am, it might take a few ""huh?!"" instances before the collar is finally threaded onto the unit properly. Filling the anti-bark unit with the spray is simple, but there's no way to know if it actually filled properly unless you test it. Testing is simple though--blow forcefully into the microphone. Just be sure it's aimed away from your face because the spray shoots surprisingly far!I put the collar on my dog while giving her praise.

So it is hard to shuffle at a good speed (shuffle - shuffle - strip - shuffle) this is the standard for dealers in most casino's. You should be able to do this in 10 seconds or less. But, when you have to slow down because the cards are dirty, all you have to do with Copag cards is wash them and they are like new. Just use cold water in a bowl with a couple drops of dove liquid soap. Wash each card one at a time, dry them with a soft towel and spread them on a table for about an hour to air dry. You have new cards again. It only takes about 10 minutes to do this, but the difference is worth the effort.

We've had the regular (not deluxe) Scoop Maid for 6 months now. It has worked out really well for us. Before getting this litter box, we'd tried the conventional litter boxes and the self-cleaning type that you roll back and forth. We had problems with odors with both, but the biggest problem was that no one wanted to deal with the mess.We own 1 cat who is about to turn 6 years old. He weighs 13-14 pounds and eats Purina One. We change out the cartridge about once every 4 weeks. The box works just as the video instructions on amazon demonstrates. We just remove the cartridge and place it in the trash can outside without any mess. Very convenient.The criticisms I do have (why the product doesn't get 5 stars from me) is the cost. I paid around $95 for the regular one, and I think that price is a bit high for the product. In addition, there is only ONE place in my town where I have been able to find the refills. They charge $15.99 per cartridge, and $45.99 for a pack of 3 (a $2.00 savings). Since that's the only store that carries the refills in my town, I have to make sure to keep one cartridge on hand at all times so that I don't ever need a refill when the store is out of stock.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,251

It is also helping him learn about magnets, as that is how the car connects to the engine.

I got a chance to demo it on adults and grandchildren, it worked great. I was happy with the amount of light, and the optics. The WA otoscope is brighter and the light adjustable but much heavier to carry. They are not comparable, and have different uses. The Dr. Mom scope is well suited for home use, and light clinic use.

He can't construct this set by himself as it was designed; but he enjoys creating more basic structures. He likes the fact that this set has cars in it (the bumper cars). The problem we encountered with this set is the rollercoaster does not work. The rollercoaster car is too wide for the track - or the track is too narrow. I called the manufacturer and they shipped a new car to me. New one didn't fit. The manufacturer said it would send new track if the new car didn't fit. But I gave up before exercising that option because I had also received a replacement set from Amazon due to one of the gears being defective. The car/rollercoaster in that set had the same problem. So, I had tried three cars and two sets of tracks - no combination worked. I chalked it up to cheap flimsy plastic and moved on. My son seems to care less about the rollercoaster part anyway.

The Shikai lotions are nice on the skin and they are thicker like a body butter or body creme. I also appreciate that they do not use parabens and the like. There IS a Coconut scent to this one but it is more of a soft Coconut/Vanilla scent. Very pleasing, however as there is no real coconut oil in the product that was dissapointing. (Could be do to the fact that coconut oil does not have a long shelf life and Shakai opts out of many of the more toxic preservatives.) They do have some great healing ingredients like wheat germ, avacado oil, shea butter and borage seed oil, however due to the fact that the lotion IS PURE WHITE and none of these listed ingredients in their more natural - AND MOST BENEFICIAL STATE - are white in color then it is obvious that they have heavily refined the ingredients leaving only a fraction of the botanical actives from many of these fabulous plants.

8473,B000798DJO,Britax,A2Q6CXLXOPZ03G,7/7,4.0,1170201600,"This stroller is awesome, really. It is very easy to use, extremely lightweight and small enough to fit anywhere. I also like that I can easily maneuver it through narrow store aisles and cram it in the smallest space in the car. You do, however, need two hands to open it. This is only due to the fact that it is so lightweight that it does not fall open on its own, but must be pushed open with the little knob with your foot.The basket underneath is on the small side, but can still accommodate a purse or a few items in the grocery store (nothing too heavy, though). The only trouble is the clearance from the stroller back; I could just barely squeeze a large 23oz. can of formula into the basket.The attached accessories bag comes in very handy; I like to keep an extra diaper and burp rag in there, as well as a bottle of water for me and a baba for my son. The outside pockets easily hold my keys and cell phone, although one of the pockets was designed to hold a water bottle. I also like that this bag can be detached and carried like a purse.The shades offer as good a coverage as you can expect from any stroller, and the peep through window is nice, but be sure you're not burning your baby's head while this is open on a sunny day. I also purchased the Britax Companion Infant Car Seat and they work perfectly together. Both shades pulled together at the same time can create a clamshell effect, which is great from grabby grannies in the mall. A big bummer about the canopy when just using the stroller is that it must be removed to fold the stroller. I found this to be so inconvenient that I ended up leaving it at home most of the time (no biggie, I usually just put a brimmed hat on my son).The five point harness is an excellent safety feature and can be adjusted to fit just right. The adjustable leg rest is great for a small baby who doesn't need to have his legs dangling over the edge yet.The only drawback to this stroller is that it becomes more difficult to maneuver as your child grows heavier. No biggie, that's to be expected with a small, lightweight stroller. I simply upgraded to another Britax stroller with bigger wheels (bigger wheels=easier to push and steer!). An excellent company with a great reputation; I will never purchase another brand for my baby transportation needs.",baby products,strollers,unknown,429

The dump was incomplete and the rake would go back with some of the material still on. Over the course of the day it would accumulate, and need sifted and the rake cleaned.

I usually give them rawhide everyday but I've been hearing that rawhides are actually bad for dogs so I decided I'd cut down on how many I give them.I got two of these bones, one each for my dogs. I expected them to chew off some of the good crunchiness off of it and then leave it alone but no, they really enjoy them. They chew them up until the tops of the bones have fallen off and then they keep on chewing. It lasts my dogs for about 2 days but then they get bored with it and I'll feed them some other kind of bones or rawhide but they'll keep going back to the bones.I've already ordered another order for them and I'm here to make a third purchase for them. So, I'm pretty happy with them.On the side of caution..not only does the boney ends get chewed off, if you're worried about choking hazards, which I don't cause they're really big pieces, the bone does break apart after some chewing on it.Also, these bones can be quite messy. I'm use to cleaning up after my dogs so that doesn't bother me much until they decided to lug the bones on to the bed and start chewing. I thought nothing of it at first because the motion of them chewing on the bones lulled me to sleep. But during the night I kept feeling these little hard pieces of bone debris. I woke up, turned on the light and my sheets were covered in a little snow fall of bone debris. So, I wouldn't recommend allowing your dog to bring them up on your furniture for that reason.Otherwise, any aggressive chewer will really enjoy this bone.",pet supplies,dogs,treats,294

MUCH better than the creams, by a long shot...as far as rub-off, for one. I'm very fair but always order medium to dark, as this gives me just enough color to make it look natural. I like to get the smaller towels...the larger ones seem a waste b/c I can cover my whole body (I am size 2) with one, plus do my face. Sometimes I will wait til it dries and use another Towel or some of their lotion. I've used the TanTowels cream and spray, as well. Great to use in between or if you run out of TanTowels. The Tan Towels ""travel"" well..no messy bottles or tubes to take a chance on leaking in your luggage. Don't be afraid to order the medium to dark towels, even if you're not fair skinned like me because the color you get is not intense but enough for a nice, natural look. My ""hint"" to applying any tan potion on your face is, once applied, use a tissue or Q-tip to gently remove tan potion from nose folds and under your eyes (don't want to enhance any dark circles you may have).

I was still a bit hungover and I ate a ton of not so healthy meals the day before. But day one wasn't too bad. I was just getting over food poisoning and I was mentally prepared to go through it. The pills are HUGE. Enough to feel like they were actual meals! The fiber drink was absolutely DISGUSTING the first time I tried it and wondered if I could even manage the whole kit without wanting to puke.Day 2At this point, I looked forward to the fiber drink. Which was pretty sad, but I knew in the end it would be good. My energy level was the same. I did do some light gym work on the first and second days, but I knew if I would not last if I kept it up so after the second day I stopped. I have been only drinking water and herbal teas for the first two days on this cleanse. Still wasn't going to the bathroom to flush out, so I took an entra colon clear that evening.Day 3The most challenging day for myself. No energy what-so-ever. It was an absolute struggle to get out of bed and getting ready for work. I picked up some pressed carrot juice and after a glass (mixed with fiber), I was back in the game. I realized that my blood sugar must have been low. This was the day I finally ""flushed"" everything out of my system...oddly, I continued to do so everytime I would have to relieve myself in the restroom. Decided to stick to the juice every morning and night.Day 4Feeling better, energy is higher. Although, I don't know why I tortured myself with watching the Food Network during my entire fast.Day 5AMAZING. My energy level was similar to when I drink cups and cups of coffee. But the best part, it was a natural energy. I made myself a smoothie with apples, spinach, cucumbers and blueberries that evening. I wanted to reintroduce myself to food in a safer way.In conclusion, I am glad I did this cleanse. I am an lacto-ovo vegetarian, so I normally eat clean. But during the holidays I went a little crazy with eating a lot of sugary and processed foods. I ate whatever cookie and sweets were around. Then I got food poisoning on Christmas which ruined me. I knew that if I completed this kit, I would get back to my old clean eating habits.I am going to continue to eat clean and raw for a couple of weeks and reintroduce dairy into my diet slowly.

I do think that MOST 8 yr olds can fly it and maybe some 5 yo kid that has an Xbox or PS3 could do it. One thing that you have to do is trim every time you power up. As the heli loses charge, you probably will have to adjust it again. It is all about lift and prop wash. I recommend that you trim at least 12"" off the floor. Prop wash on the ground is about 3 times what it is 12"" off the ground. The heli will naturally rotate CW (left to right) due to torque of the rotors on the body of the aircraft. (See Leonardo Da Vinci for reference) The tail rotor spins in the opposite direction (that is why it is on the right side of the boom.)This is very similar to a real helicopter with no counter-rotation main rotors. When you take off, apply slight right rudder. When in suspension also apply slight right rudder for anti-cw rotation.Practice on a lawn or soft surface. BTW, this thing won't fly in most outdoor environments. The SMALLEST of winds will blow this thing 100 feet in the air.

Usually I get a dry, almost crispy feel to my hair the first few days to a week after a home dye, but I did not experience it with this, surely because of the serum.I should mention that this dye can turn an odd, almost frightening red early on in the processing and it might scare you into rinsing it out too soon. Let it go and step away from the mirror. This red turns to an orange and then to a dark purple, and after 30 minutes the end result will be perfect.

I don't--WON'T-follow instructions to the letter (2X/day? Organic apples, bananas, blueberries? Purified water?) And I'm not a die-hard health nut, so I don't mind adding in soy (milk), or dairy (kefir), or nuts (almond butter).Still, it's a lot of nutrition for the price (&lt;$1/meal); a bargain even if you factor in the added fruit. And an ""ultimate"" bargain if you factor in the supplements provided (vitamins, minerals, herbal supplements) that you'd need to buy separately. Probably should check these ingredients, though, to make sure you can tolerate them.There's no getting around the greens-flavored taste of this powder, but it's no worse than other superfood beverages. The product's website has some good recipes and suggestions. One I've used is similar to what's on the canister (minus the ""organic""), except I substitute vanilla soymilk for the water (flavor/thickness). I include 1/2 cup frozen raspberry/blueberry mix that changes the color from green to purplish and sweetens the flavor. (I know fresh is better, but--trust me--cold is what helps makes this concoction palatable.)After three days of drinking this for breakfast, I felt more energized. It's filling as a light meal would be (3-4 hours as opposed to the advertised 3-6 hours). Didn't really experience the ""detox"" side-effects that others have mentioned (at least nothing I wouldn't experience from a high-fiber meal), but I also chased it with a bottle of water.As other reviewers mentioned, this is a bit of a ""stone soup fable"" misnomer. If you add 1/2-cup berries, 1/2 apple, and a banana (along w/cup of soymilk), this will be a pretty filling, higher-calorie (but nutritionally dense) meal.It's completely organic, vegan, kosher, free of glutens, soy, yeast, salt, dairy, egg, and cholesterol. The protein (16 g) is from vegan sources (quinoa/millet, amaranth, brown rice, spirulina).Says it's unsweetened, but other astute reviewers have pointed out there's stevia (a natural alternative calorie-free sweetener). Had to run out to check the canister myself.If you can get past the flavor and find a recipe that works for you, I definitely recommend Ultimate Meal!",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,353

I live near Washington DC right next to Rock Creek, and these awful biters were making it impossible for my kids to play outside---we'd get bit 3-4 times just going from the driveway to our front door every evening.Due to the warmer-than-average spring, I started scattering these granules all throughout my lawn and in every possible crack and intersection of roots that might hold water after a rainfall. Combined with additional birdfeeders and planting marigolds, rosemary, and geraniums, (and dumping out containers filled with water after rain) we haven't seen a single mosquito yet, even after a couple days of 80+ weather in April and May. I usually re-apply every 2 weeks or after a soaking rain, and the 30-oz. size lasted through about a month and a half---so environmentally safe AND cheaper than hiring a company to come and chemically treat several times during the summer.I know the skeeters are out in other areas, and I just bought a jug for my son's daycare because he was sent home covered in bites yesterday.

What a disappointing Christmas for my son. Evidently we are not the only ones that had this issue as they are selling the pedals on the Fisher Price website for $5. We placed the order as the only other option would be to pack it up and return it hoping that we can find one in stock at our local retailer. According to the FP website, it can take up to 72 hours before they even acknowledge our order. We are heading to Lowe's today to try and find a bolt that fits the pedal.We also ordered the Hot Wheels game on Nov 9th from Amazon thinking it would be here in time for Christmas. Another disappointment. We found out that it will not be available to ship until Feb 25th. What's up with that???? Did they not produce enough of the game??I also agree that the graphics could be better and all of the other learning systems we own do have options for ""levels"" of play. I can't believe that FP didn't think this through.Again, very disappointing.....I only wish the CEO of Fisher Price could have spent Christmas with us so he could have seen my son's face when the toy broke.

However, at $60/5lb jug, it was getting pretty pricey.I accidentally ordered two jugs in the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor (wanted the Double Chocolate which i hear is decent). It's not that the ingredients aren't good, I can't STAND the flavor. It's by far the worst tasting whey protein I have ever had. I've tried everything, water, milk, almond milk, soy milk, even adding a bit of cocoa powder to it. Nothing. I now dread my post-work out shake. I cry to myself every time I see the unopened jug sitting there, waiting for me to reluctantly open it and consume the hellish powder that lurks inside. I'd give it away to someone but that's just plain cruel.If you don't care about flavor, or simply have some sort of strange, mutilated taste buds, go ahead and get the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor.

It comes with 4 screws that need to be predrilled to mount itself to the door.3) Shipping cost was too much for such a small product.

38658,B0002DK2DU,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Green and Beige",A2L54V28T1KUCV,3/3,3.0,1339372800,"I got my Omega Paw on Friday after using a make shift litter box from a huge Sterilite Container that I had cut open for the purpose. After seeing the video and reading some reviews about it I figured I'd be able to save some time from scooping and having my cat Buddy clawing at me while I scooped his poo.The packaging was deceptively small - for a while I thought they had delivered the wrong thing. Then I realised it did not come assembled. The assembly wasn't that hard - instructions on the box was simple enough and as Buddy occupied himself playing with the box it came in I was able to put together the Omega Paw in less than 2 minutes. The immediate thing I noticed though was the quality. Whilst the plastic it is designed with makes for an exceptionally light weight product- easy for even a frail arthritic 92 year old granny to turn/ flip over- it also does not make for a very strong product. As I was pressing the grill into place in the little snaps I could see the plastic grill bending with the least amount pressure that I was applying. Neither did the plastic grill lock completely into place as I had expected it should - which is probably why some litter always makes its way into the scoop tray.Additionally the pins are plastic and not at all durable. Thankfully I haven't had to open it since I bought it but I have my doubts about the durability of the pins, as again - they seem to be manufactured of cheap plastic and feel as if they would break if too much pressure is applied in moving them.Moreover, it doesn't completely remove all of Buddy's doo doo... I find myself still having to use his old school scooper to pick up pieces left behind. Maybe I'm not flipping it right? But isn't it supposed to be so deceptively simple that all I'd have to do is flip it? So how the heck could I not be flipping it correctly? Or is it that my cat's poo is so super that it's impervious to the science behind the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box?Finally, and this is more about my preference than anything - the regular size is a lot smaller than I had anticipated it would be. Buddy's a 9 month old kitty but he's already tall and lanky. I ought to have gone with the Large size to give the guy more room to do his business, especially after the large sized make shift container he used before, but still, he manages. To his credit, he didn't need to be re-trained to use this litter box and to the credit of Omega Paw the entrance is suitably high enough so that when he's scratching away at the litter not much gets tossed outside at all.I'd have given this product 2 1/2 stars but Amazon doesn't give me that option - so I decided to be generous and round it off to the nearest star- hence a 3 star rating. All in all it's a wonderful concept, but maybe a better quality material ought to be used and maybe whatever design flaw there is that still allows clumped litter to remain in the box after the flip could be rectified.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,558

STUDIES INDICATE THAT THIS CHEMICAL CAUSES EXTREMELY DETRMENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS WHEN TAKEN IN SMALL QUANTITIES OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, LOOK IT UP FOR YOURSELFAbout two months after I started using NKO I received a free sample of megared krill oil. Sorry megared, not gonna work.Sorbitol was right there in the ingredients. On the package, megared explains that their krill causes no fishy after taste because the fats are carried in a phospholipid form and are readily absorbed by the body. I believe this is probably true because NKO has no after taste. Why then megared? Why do you use sorbitol? My guess is they want to avoid the inevitable fishy smell that the bottle has when you open it. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK. Though less potent, the fishy smell is still obviously there, the sorbitol has a slight masking effect but he smell but it is still clearly present. So, people that complained about the smell, go ahead and switch to megared, you will have your slightly better smell when you open the bottle.

It leaves my skin extremely soft in all the right places, certainly improves the look of the skin and of course just makes me feel better. It is not greasy, something I simply detest, yet it gives my skin a nice looking glow...making it look quite touchable.I wear very little to know make up normally, but when I do, I find this cream completely compatible with what little I do use. It has a nice delicate fragrance that in no way overwhelms...which is another of my pet peeves. I am a girl and want to smell like one, not like a.....well, you know.This stuff does not only work on my hands, an area of my body that always needs work, but it works well over the entire me.

After 5-6 washings the colour relaxes into a rich, warm, very lovely and natural brown...but I have to suffer a little darkness to get there.

The space saver is meant to be more like a high chair and is meant to accomodate young babies, but as a booster this seat beats that one out of the water.

The adjustable base is easy to adjust and allows me to put my daugther at just the right height.The tray is nice and secure and she has not been able to pop it off, which is a great as that's an issue I've had with seats in the past!There are 2 things that kept me from giving it 5 stars, 1) I would love to see a 5 pt. harness option. My 8 month old is a busy body and she as able to turn and pull herself up unless I have the waist part very tight, which means adjusting it depending on what she's wearing and what kind of diaper I have her in (cloth or disposable). Might not be an issue for some, but it is for us. 2) the snap in tray doesn't snap in tightly. She easily removes it each time I put her in the seat.

Then came the baby bonkie, a swaddling sleepsack. It was the best thing ever. Very user friendly and it had our baby sleep through the night instantly. However, that too got too small too soon. Then I found the miracle blanket. It's a little less user friendly than the baby bonkie. It takes a bit more effort to wrap your baby up in this. But it's not hard and you get the hang of it fairly quickly. Our baby is now 25"" long and weighs almost 15 lbs and he still fits comfortably in the miracle blanket.

At the beginning the feeding did take a long time but after less than a week she learned to work the nipple. And because you cannot use traditional steam type bottle warmers with this bottle it took a little more effort to warm the bottle in a pan of hot water. My second baby was always able to use regular bottles until I switched her to plain milk last week. Then it was spit up city. I happened to have one of the older versions of this bottle left over and started using it. From the first day there was no more spitting up. It did take her about 2 days to fully figure out the nipple, but it has been no problem for the last 2 weeks. I wish I had never gotten rid of the other 10 of these bottles that I had. I am going to buy more but I must admit right now that I am purchasing the older version which is still available in my area. Although I have seen the newer version and love the new way the bottom vent is designed I have read alot here about nipple collapse with this new version and my friend has also had the same problem. She has also told me that if you don't get the bottom vent in perfect on this newer version, you will experience the leaking problem because it will twist into the threads. That is enough to make me stick with the ""oldie, but goodie"" and deal with the extra time that using these bottles requires. And one final note, even though it says that people who have bought these bottles have also bought the First Years Bottle Warmer, if you use a steam based bottle warmer these bottles will leak from the bottom during heating. You can use the type of warmer that you fill with water such as the Avent one.",baby products,feeding,gift sets,332

8905,B000FEGUIM,Philips Norelco 7110 Cordless Rechargeable Shaver,A264K42EKYAT1D,10/10,4.0,1173657600,"I've used Norelco shavers for years and I like them. After about 4 years my most recent Norelco stopped holding a charge, so I picked up this one.Pros:* It gives a great shave! They've changed the heads a bit and added some holes. Whatever it is, my shave is about 30% smoother better than my older Norelco and with less time.* It's quiet. I can actually have a conversation with my wife while shaving. This wasn't possible with my older shaver.* It is significanly lighter than my older model.* Cleanup is really easy. You just flush the head with hot water once a week. Once a month or so you're supposed to take out the shaving disks in the head and brush them clean but my guess is that once a quarter would be plenty. Since cleanup is a major hassle, this is a terrific feature.Cons:* It takes 8 hours to charge. Yikes! Eight hours. My old shaver never took over an hour.* It's hard to tell how much charge you have left. My older model had a gas gauge type indicator right on the front. This one just has a green light that goes on when you turn on the razor. When it runs low on juice you'll get a flashing red light when you finish shaving. This isn't nearly as handy.* The shape isn't as ergonomic as the other model probably because of the water rinsing feature. There are little plastic fins that stick out from the handle presumably to help you hold on when it's wet. It doesn't feel very good in your hand.* There is no case to store it in. This is a drawback if you use it to travel.* The head is supposed to be replaced once a year. Huh??? This is apparently the case on all new Norelco shavers. These heads aren't cheap, folks. I certainly wouldn't replace one unless I was having problems with the shaver -- and then I'd probably buy a new one.The bottom line is that I'm very pleased with this shaver. It does the job very well and it was quite inexpensive. I would certainly recommend this model over the higher end models if price is a consideration.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,370

We put the collar on her sometimes and do not turn it on - she has figured it out - the collar means no barking. There have been comments about the battery life. Our batteries have lasted six months or more. The BIG deal is you MUST turn the collar OFF when you take it off your dog.(not intuitive)We had to learn the hard way. If you leave the collar on it eats batteries. This is a terrific product that has made our little comedian go from being a pain in the xxx, to easy to manage. I forgot to mention, I took her to a excellent dog trainer, who trained me to handle her and she still does all the commands right, even after using the collar.

She has both a long coat and a very prolific downy white undercoat that seemingly sheds 24/7. It's got a cotton ball texture; tufts of it stick out, and if you pull it, you get a pouf of very soft white down that is guaranteed to stick to you and everything in its path.My former regimen was to use a rubber curry brush for the long outer coat, and (the part I hate), an undercoat rake. No matter how much I brush her, I'm covered with hair, and there's a grocery bag FULL of hair. It's an hour to two hour task, and as much as I love my dog, a huge, hairy nuisance!When I got the Furminator, I was impressed with the heft of it. I bought the large size with the idea that it'd be that much less effort (generally speaking, the small size is the cheapest, but it's so small, it would take forever on anything but the smallest or unhairiest dog. And the difference in price between the medium and large is, at most places, only a few bucks. If you're going to invest in the furminator, go for the size that makes the most out of every pass over the dog's coat.)So I tried a few swoops on the dog. And yeah, it resulted in a ton of hair, but if I just run my fingers through her coat, I get pretty much the same result.I got a grocery bag (to store the hair pulled off the comb) and set to work. On the initial combing, it took a little less than the usual hour it does. What was interesting, though, is that I used only the Furminator, not the undercoat rake and curry comb combo I usually use. In that sense, it was less time and effort.The bag, as usual, was full. But the thing that really sold me on the Furminator is how good her coat looked. Very professional looking, like she had just gotten back from the groomer's.Now it's a few days later, and lo and behold, one of the promises the maker of the Furminator made seems to actually be true",pet supplies,cats,grooming,400

That said, I purchased this item for my 2 year old nephew. ha. Because, even in my rebellion, I too see the importance of being technologically adept. I have played around with this quite a bit and it seems to be really educational. It's also not too terribly advanced for my nephew- I think we underestimate the brainpower of toddlers sometimes. anyway, this is the first leapfrog product that I've bought so I can't really compare to the other toys they offer but I think it's a pretty cool little thing. The only problems I had with it was that it seemed to not want to turn on at first, but I soon figured it out after some pouting and plugging and unplugging and such. I took the advice from other reviews and purchased the power adapter, which is helpful and all, but the screen still flashes ""low battery"" if you don't put batteries in the console itself. There were also concerns voiced by other buyers that the mouse is too small or oddly shaped, but i think it's just fine...especially for little hands. My favorite feature is that you can send mail for the kid to check when they turn it on. but I suppose if your child already has a Blackberry then he/she will probably be less than impressed with this, but I think it's a pretty cool intro to computers and learning to type and develop the skills that they will have to learn at some point. All that to say, I recommend this. I think it's neat. Much peace and love!",toys games,electronics for kids,electronic toys,296

I wanted to get one for a boy, but as I said this got the best reviews, so I figured it just looks like a house he won't care. Well he didn't care. He loved it. My three year old who is still in a toddler bed was very jealous. We had to make a makeshift tent for him using a sheet and pillows. Anyway this is a great tent. My big concern with a lot of these bed tents was that the sheet was attached. My son just turned five and is still wearing pullups at night and sometimes they leak. An attached sheet just wasn't a option. The sheet that comes with the tent is detachable and is a pretty good quality. Most of the character sheets that the kids like so much are of much poorer quality than this.That being said, it's still not too easy to change the sheet since you do have to take the tent off, which is not too hard because it's just attached with velcro, but the room is small and there's not much floor space for the tent while I am changing the sheet so It's just a little pain. I was thinking of buying another sheet and attaching the velcro that comes with adhesive so I can have another set. I think it would be pretty easy.The tent seems pretty durable, but as other reviewers have said it does get hot in there and my son insists on sleeping with the door flap closed. So when he's asleep I go in and open the flaps up and aim his little fan inside so he's cooler. It helps a lot.Overall it was a great purchase and I would highly recommend it.

This is confusing to younger children. He solved the problem himself by sitting on top of the train so that his bum constantly pressed the button, making it go.

While this blend may use other ingredients to create the blend the primary scent is the characteristic sweet woodsy fragrance of sandalwood.Sandalwood is the name for a variety of trees (19) in the genus Santalum. True Sandalwood comes from Hawaii, Australia and India. The essential oil is very expensive and the quality varies according to the age of the tree and the species. It is naturally antibacterial which can assist in keeping skin clear of blemishes.

No one batted an eye at the size of the bag and most didn't even notice we had animals with us. They fit under the seat with only a little squeezing in the height dimension. They were plenty sturdy in most respects but one of the cats scratched through the mesh used for the windows. The cat could easily have increased the size of the hole and caused problems so I ended up having to lean over and pet her frequently to keep her agitated digging at the bag to a minimum. Overall the bags worked for us but I was disappointed in how easily the cats were able to damage them. Maybe they work better with dogs or people with a loooooong time to train the cats to get used to the bags.

One is in our bedroom and other in our daughter's, they both work great.Read the instructions. They explain that you must add salt to the water, the exact amount will depend on your water, but you'll figure it out after a few uses. I add a little shy of 1/4 teaspoon and the humidifier runs quietly from when we go to bed until morning. If I'm heavy handed with the salt then it gurgles a little and it runs out of water before we wake but it's not a big deal. If I was scant on the salt then it puts out less steam.I only have two complaints. One is there is no on/off switch, so you have to unplug it to turn it off. Second, there is still an inch or so of water in the reservoir when the water is too low for it to emit steam. The unit works best if you dump this out and start fresh every night. As other reviewers have noted (and as mentioned in the instructions), there are black mineral flecks in the remaining water. I just dump it in the toilet and refill the reservoir (and add salt). It seems all the affordable humidifiers have some convenience flaw. This humidifier is so affordable, these two complaints are so minor I obviously bought a second one.You can't tell from the picture, but you can rotate the blue part to any direction (it houses all the inner workings and vents the steam). It's a super simple design that works. If you find the blue part ""floats,"" then you've over-filled it past the mark on the reservoir.Our apartment is cold and drafty.

My 2 year old son is pretty small for his age - maybe 25 pounds, maybe 34 inches. He's tiny. So when I saw that the ""large"" wheely bug is supposedly for 3 years old and up I figured my tiny guy would certainly need the small. Still, I hated to buy the wrong size and then have to ship it back. So I found a store in town that offers wheely bugs and went there to physically have my son try them out. Am I glad I did! The small is so tiny that I cannot imagine it being appropriate for any child. If your child is so small as to need the small version, chances are he or she should not be riding it. Remember, these things do not have seat belts or other safety features. It's a fast-moving ride-on, on chair casters. The small model looks suitable for a stuffed doll, perhaps. My son fits on the large version with no problem. His feet hit the floor flat. He can climb on and off with no difficulty. Also, be aware that this really only rolls well on hardwood floors or other smooth, flat surfaces. It's tough to roll on carpet of any sort - even area rugs. Would work well on a smooth, flat driveway or in an unfinished basement. So please do not hesitate to purchase the large model, unless your child is very young or very, very tiny (maybe shouldn't be on this toy, in that case), and do be sure you have someplace where your child can have fun riding it.",toys games,baby toddler toys,push pull toys,285

First of all and most importantly, it gives a nice close shave. It can be used with the electrical cord or via the rechargeable battery. I didn't give it 5 stars because I find the trimmer a bit hard to use since it slides out over the shaver head and the trimmer blade is inline with the shaver itself. This forces you to hold the shaver at a 90 degree angle to your face in order to trim. Although this is fine for shaving, it's a bit awkward when you're trying to trim a sideburn or moustache. My previous Braun shaver had a trimmer that flipped out at 90 degrees to the shaver itself, so looking in the mirror and using the trimmer was a more natural process. Also, your hand naturally wants to hold the shaver on the soft-touch ON/OFF button and holding the shaver at 90 degrees to your face causes me to press harder on the ON/OFF button.

5154,B0009XLVEC,Premier Gentle Leader Head Dog Collar,A17CEHUSQOYJ7G,5/12,2.0,1130803200,"There are various types of head collar on the market today, all designed to do roughly the same thing. They discourage your dog from pulling by making pulling intensely uncomfortable, and they give you enough physical leverage to control your dog if he does decide to pull.What could be wrong with that? Well firstly, dogs really don't like head collars. I have never ever seen a dog happily wear a Gentle Leader on the first attempt - not suprising since the device applies pressure on the sensitive bridge of the nose. I have, however, seen many dogs cry, wail, claw their faces, and/or just shut down and miserably refuse when first introduced to a head collar. It is true that you can eventually teach most dogs to accept these devices (dogs are very tolerant animals), but why not just invest that time into teaching your dog to walk politely on a leash in a regular collar?Secondly, this device only works while it is on the dog. In other words, it doesn't actually teach the dog anything - if you take the halti off, the dog will start to pull again. Not exactly a long term solution - unless you want to keep your dog on a Gentle Leader for the rest of his life.So, if your dog pulls, what do you do? I'm personally a fan of the Koehler method for teaching loose leash walking, as outlined in ""The Koehler Method of Dog Training"" (note",pet supplies,dogs,collars,245

Not really although you want to be careful that they don't get stuck with their bodies pushed up against the center wall.Also, don't expect to move this.

The cat would sit there for hours digging out food piece by piece. I tried several things to mess up the angle so she could no longer do this and still get food but was unsuccessful.

After 12 years of fairly constant use, 24 hours a day, I needed to replace it.I am now on my second one, which I expect to last a long time. The build seems slightly improved, and the power cord is now more robust. The box came with a number of accessories that were not included in the past.

I switched channels and saw another baby in a different crib. Only one neighbor has a baby so this thing was picking up a baby from at least two houses away! I guess it at least has range, but that means anyone nearby could be looking into my house. That means if you want any sense of security that no one is listening in on your conversations through the day, you have to turn the video camera off every morning and after each nap. That means you also would have to use mounting tape so that hitting the off button wouldn't tilt your camera so that you had to reset it every time. This is too much work for too little security in my opinion.If you can move beyond the security issue (I was willing to just turn the camera off every time), the monitor still needs to function properly. I got a lot of static at different distances, near and far, whether doors were closed or shut. The second night, the audio completely glitched and I had nothing but static. I still had video, but without the audio to wake me up the video is of no use.I would also suggest using a different option to secure the cord if you choose to use this monitor. The tape on the fasteners included in the package is not strong. They came loose from our eggshell-painted walls the first night it was up. Replacing the tape on the fasteners with a more heavy duty mounting tape might work.I returned this and ordered the Baby Touch which I am using for the first time tonight. So far I already like the new one better. More expensive, but with the digital technology I needn't worry about anyone snooping into my home or having to turn the camera on and off. If you are willing to order this Day and Night version over and over to get one that isn't a lemon (I have read of multiple in the reviews), it might be worth it for you to save the money. I'm not willing to do it personally so I picked one with better reviews. Hopefully this time it will work out.Pros:priceeasy set updecent picture qualityhandset size is convenient. not easily lost, but easy to carry aroundCons:no securitydidn't work properly past the first night!cannot control the camera movements from a remote locationlots of static in the audioThe fact that the monitor stopped working and the complete lack of security, along with the static that made the baby's cries so hard to distinguish make me give this such a low rating. I would give it only 1 star since it didn't work, but I think if the system worked it would be a good one if you don't mind the security issues.",baby products,safety,monitors,482

I went to my local pharmacy and purchased something to put in the freezer that had little pea like beads in it that fastened around the neck. I paid $20 and it was horrible. It was made out of plastic and the edges cut into my skin and it was too tight around the neck.I was desperate for something comfortable, that could adjust to a bigger neck size and be used as a heating pad and for cold therapy. When I got this I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of this item. It is very well made, very cushioned and it fits comfortably around my neck and holds well with the velcro. It can be helpful for big necks and little necks because it can be adjusted.It covers a lot of area and I like the fact that it covers the back of my shoulders well, the nape of the neck all the way up to the bottom of my ears and jaw bone as well as all around the throat.It is a little tricky at first getting it to warm up to a temperature in the micro that is perfect. In my Sharp Carousel microwave it takes about 35-45 seconds on each side. Sometimes more sometimes less. If it feels too hot, just let it cool off a minute or so. Once you do this a few times you will get the hang of it and know exactly how long to heat it up for. The heat really helps my neck spasms. It stays warm for about 20 minutes or so and then wanes. I just throw it back in the microwave again.The cold version is nice, but does not last very long and does not feel as cold as I would like it to be despite being in the freezer over night. I noticed the coolness will last only between 15-20 minutes tops. When it is cold, it feels like a cool damp towel and is quite flexible, not hard like a block of ice.When the coolness wears off, I take a bunch of ice cubes, place them in a ziploc bag, wrap that in a dishtowel and place it under the Elasto-gel Cervical Collar. Then I close it around my neck with the velcro and I am ok for a while longer. It holds the ice pack on for me.I would give it 5 stars if the cold and warm therapy would last longer, but the ice cube method works and the collar holds it in place wonderfully.If you do the ice cube method, please make sure you keep the ice cubes inside a ziploc bag and keep a dishtowel around it because this cervical collar is not allowed to get wet. If it gets wet, the gel inside it will get ruined and render the collar useless.",health personal care,health care,pain relievers,484

The incision was about 9-10"" long. About three months after it had closed it was still a bright, vermillion stripe on my you-know-what. After some initial experimentation with wear time and secondary fixation, I worked into a rhythm that's a little different from the manufacturer's directions. I cut the pad into four strips of equal width. I took two and applied them to the scar, overlapping in the middle. I then used three very large, flexible fabric band-aids to cover the ends, and one for the overlap in the middle. This was enough to hold the silicone in place for a week at a time. I realize that is vastly longer than the recommended wear time, but it works for me with no irritation. The silicone stays in place unless I'm really active, but I can easily mush it back into position. On Sunday mornings, I remove it, wash it, wash ME, then replace and apply new band aids. The first two strips lasted two months, and they look as if they could still be used even more. I'm on my second pair now. It's been a total of three months, and the scar is hard to even see - maybe a faint pink. It's really amazing. Anyone who's actually seen the original incision can't believe it.I'm not necessarily recommending that anyone make up their own usage instructions like I did. I'm just reporting that this worked for me, worked remarkably well, and that I made one $50 pad last for a full four months (assuming this lasts another month, which I have no reason to believe it won't.)

We have a baby with lots of reflux and spit-up issues, so I've needed to keep an eye on him while he's in the car seat to be sure he's not spitting up and choking. This product has a nice big mirror, convex so that it magnifies the baby well (especially if you can get the angle right), and Noah loves the puppy. He laughs every time he sees it. This product is PERFECT if you have an automobile with a center headrest in the back, or a car with an anchor on the back behind the seats. However, if you have an SUV with no center headrest, it becomes much more difficult. I've tried every trick I could think of, and wound up folding a stiff piece of fabric to go underneath it (works sort of as a pseudo headrest), and velcro to hold the fabric and bear on the leather seat. I also tied it off around the headrests on either side to stabilize it. It's now quite stable and in a good position, but the velcro doesn't stick well to leather so I have to restick it every so often. My final reaction is that although we love it, if I find something that has a better way to adhere to the back seat without a headrest, I'll probably switch it out and put the bearview on his crib instead.

Now baby number six is using it and they ALL have loved it! It's one of the few toys I've saved between kids and I'll most likely keep it for all my future kids and grandkids!I take issue with the complaints that children don't play with the toy ""properly"". Are we dictating how children should play, now, too, as well as learn?? Even babies have to follow the rules and do things according to someone else's pre-determined idea of ""proper development""? PLEASE!! Let's let babies be babies. True learning is self-directed, not teacher or parent directed.Yes, toddlers usually prefer to dump the blocks out and put them back in without the lid at first, maybe for quite a while. They also love putting other stuff in the bucket. What's wrong with that? When they're older they usually figure out the shape-sorting aspect on their own and become enthralled with that for a while. If they never use the toy as a shape-sorter so what? They'll still learn their shapes on their own without you ""teaching"" them and they'll learn whatever other ""skills"" this toy is supposed to teach as well. Can we not try to controll our kids' learning at such a young age - there's enough of that later for most kids.This toy is a useful learning tool, though not neccesarily in the way every parent will want. It's also fun and relatively cheap and more durable than a cardboard box or some homemade alternatives. If you can allow your child to use it as they desire I highly recommend it.

I purchased the deluxe model and the standard collar. I thought I would need the deluxe with it's variable control for our most talkative dogs, but the standard model worked better on all the dogs we worked with. My short-haired dogs trained very rapidly, but the long haired collies took longer but finally got the idea that a bark equaled a shock.The shock is quite shocking, I tried it on myself and gave a bark and once was enough. I don't think it's cruel, unless the dog does not train and continues to shock themselves. Keep an eye on them to see how they react. I just use the collars when we go for truck rides to not bother the neighbors when we are driving out. If you have a persistent barker you may need to keep a close watch when using the collars they are not recommended to be on the dog continually.",pet supplies,dogs,collars,188

I think our house was much colder than the NICU and my wrapping was just inferior to that of the nurses. From the moment I wrapped them in the sleep sack, they slept wonderfully; the change was instantaneous! I ordered them in every size... my only word of caution is to follow the sizing as listed by the company. I assumed they would fit into the preemie size past the 5 lb mark, just because they were so tiny, but in fact by the time they hit 5 lbs, the neck hole was getting pretty tight, and that can't be adjusted because it zips from the top downward.

The cleaning agent provided, coupled with the very soft brushes did little at removing stubborn dirt. Hoover's suggestion of using a strong detergent and a stiff brush to remove the dirt made me wonder why I needed the machine in the first place.There is no way to disable the vacuum pickup, so using a stronger, non-recommended cleaner was not possible since the vacuum would bring it into the machine. If the vacuum could be turned off, it could be used as a simble scrubber, but even that is not possible.The scrubbing brushes provided are very soft, with no substitutes available for harder jobs.The FloorMate is a good machine to use if you have already spotless floors and want to maintain them.

His only complaint is that it tends to tug at his hairs a little bit at times, but he said he has gotten used to it. I read somewhere online while researching what shavers to buy that it takes about a month to adjust to a new shaver, so a little irritation and tugging is probably to be expected at first.

We searched all over for a opening, there was none, and had to cut off the cardboard sides. The hard plastic top and bottom were wired to the dog, at least in 10 areas, and we had to be cut them off with wire cutters. The dog was also screwed into the bottom plastic frame. We had to use a long screwdriver to remove at least 4 screws which were down at least 6 inches into the stand, this made it difficult to see and to maintain the tension. Then we had to remove at least 3 more screws in other places. I know that many companies wire there toys to prevent shoplifting, but I have never experienced the trouble that I had with this toy. We were ready to send the item back, but did not want our child to be dissapointed. I would definitely suggest not to purchase this item, it was insulting what we had to go through to remove it.

Which I do not care to place on my sensitive skin to be absorbed. The company did reply back but only avoided my question about the use of pesticides saying it was a food grade oil.

3133,B000IOSHTY,Obsession Eau de Parfum for Women by Calvin Klein,A1K5DUV1L52MUD,32/33,5.0,1098489600,"I have been wearing Obsession by Calvin Klein since it was first launched in 1985, the year I first arrived in California. It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma, this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla, mandarin orange, peach and lemon that make up the scent of Obsession.My preference is more of a racy, provocative, alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers. With my skin irritations, asthma and allergies I have no problems with spraying my body parts with Obsession. The color is quite appealing, reminding me of Spiced Rum with the brown, amber and gold tones. Obsession cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear, indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings.This is definitely a feminine scent, sweet, sexy and not too fruity or powerful. There is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease. Sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces.Once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin I detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance.net that Obsession has oriental spices. It really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years. This is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons.I would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal. The appeal of Obsession seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties, from conservative ladies to party animals.Although it is a darker color than most fragrances, there is no staining on clothing, but I do not wear sweaters, whites or turtlenecks. When I do use the glass jar I have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish/brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips.Obsession is a potent and romantic perfume for evening. The prices of the assorted sizes of Obsession range from forty to sixty dollars.",beauty,fragrance,women s,411

23039,B000JPIJD6,Joe's Handy Dandy Notebook,A44J68VT9WADQ,1/1,3.0,1272499200,"This notebook was purchased as a birthday gift to replace a Blue's Clues notebook lost by our 2-year old grandson. He had resorted to grabbing everyone's spiral notebook and available pen or pencil he could lay his hands on. This caused considerable friction with parents and older siblings. Upon seeing the newly purchased Joe's Handy Dandy Notebook, all interest in the other toys immediately ceased and this notebook became the only toy played with, for several weeks. The notebook itself is durable enough, but keeping track of the wax writing instrument is a major problem. While the notebook is a bit pricey, the utility-cost value is thought to be worth it. There is only one issue with this item, and that is the writing instrument. 1. Only one comes with the notebook. and 2. One cannot buy only the writing instrument, without buying another notebook. Twenty five dollars+ is a bit much when an easily lost component is the only thing needing replacement. The ability to separately purchase a replacement writing tool - at a reasonable price - or supplying an additional tool, would be beneficial from the purchaser's perspective. While understanding this is a for-profit venture, a reasonable profit can still be maintained by making additional writing tools available. And yes, it is understood that buying another entire notebook-writing tool combination increases the profit, it may also deter repeat sales, such as the one I made. Although I'm well satisfied with the purchase and results, it is unlikely there would be a repeat purchase from me. This single issue prevented the notebook from getting a 5-star rating from me.",toys games,learning education,reading writing,270

The larger the drum, the deeper the sound (see comments for a link to a page with audio for each size drum). The mallet is a plastic stick with a foam/rubber rainbow-colored head.When we decided to place an order, we had a hard time choosing just one of these, and since we have two girls we opted to buy both the 6"" and the 10"". They are quite different in size and in tone, but sound really neat played together, which I love. Both the small and large drum have a deep, earthy, pleasing sound. Although I read this was the case, it was hard to imagine that such a little whimsically-designed drum could produce such a nice tone.I think that although this isn't a real drum set, in the long run I think being able to produce pleasing sounds from a small and inexpensive instrument will have more tangible value, and will inspire confidence and - perhaps - if her interest is sincere, an introduction to learning to play the drums in the future.This is a perfect drum for any child with a budding interest. And by far, it's greatest attribute? It's easy on the ears - just in case they really take to it - the kids won't be chasing all the adults out of the house with it Christmas morning.Highly recommended.Note",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play,355

Well, she put a Chai Tea bag in my cup, put a shot of vanilla on top of it and poured water up to 3/4 of the cup and topped it off with steamed milk. She told me to give it a few minutes, a stir and I should be ready to go. To my surprise, with a tsp of sugar, it tasted exactly like its more expensive counterpart. I did the rest of my shopping and before I checked out, I went back to the young lady and said, thank you for showing me another way to make my favorite drink, can I buy those tea bags in here? She said that the tea bags that Starbucks use, are kind of pricey, but that she tried the one by Celestial Seasonings ""Honey Vanilla Chai,"" and it was the closest to our beloved drink.

I usually steep it with hot water and top it with either half&half or just milk with 1 tsp of sugar (I've also tried a tsp of honey which is equally as good).

When I first read about it, I thought it was a joke and couldn't stop laughing at the cat toilet that someone had 'invented', but the thing really works well. We have 2 cats (sisters, 9 months old) and they seem to do very well with it. One of the cats started using it immediately and preferred it over the old litter box. The other took about a week to train (suggested time frame from the company). In the training process there were a couple of accidents, but they were all in our laundry room. Ironically, one of the accidents was on the instruction manual for the Cat Genie! After this initial phase-in of 1-1.5 weeks, we haven't had any problems. We set the device to clean itself 2 times per day when our cats are inactive (4am and 4pm) and that works well. We have it hooked up to our laundry drain pipe for waste disposal and that works well (no clogs so far, although I have heard that others have problems if the waste isn't removed often enough, i.e. less than once per day)We both love the device and think that it is worth the price that is being charged and the fact that we don't have to scoop and dispose of normal cat litter. We had been thinking about getting one of the other 'automatic' litter boxes, but you still have to empty these devices on a weekly basis and I've heard that they don't work well.As with any consumer product there are faults, but I feel the gains much out way the faults.Pros:-The first fully automatic litter box!-only $ 330 (not much for what it does)-relatively reliable (could take vacation without too much worry for litter box, although I would want someone to check-in once or twice)-The box is always clean for the cats (they seem to prefer this now that they are used to it)-The plastic litter pellets are clean and are easy to sweep upCons:-somewhat loud (not as loud as a washing machine though)-litter pieces tend to scatter out (we are buying a special hood that just came out)-smell of cleaning solution is strong (it is a pleasant smell, but it smells like cleaning solution in a large part of the house for an hour after a cleaning cycle)-$330. Thats a lot of money for anything, but especially on a litter box-somewhat large (the bowl is larger than a standard toilet bowl, but is about the same size as our previous litter box, so it makes sense I guess)Also, some people complain about the cost of the consumables (litter pellets, and cleaning solution), but I think I agree with the company in that the consumables cost about the same price as the normal litter, if not a bit cheaper.Improvements I would like to see for V2.0:-more flexible cleaning times (for 2 times per day it cleans 12 hrs apart, 3 cycles is 8 hrs apart, and so on). I would like it to clean at 4am and at 1pm but this isn't possible now.-It would be nice if it came with a hood, but that is an add-on now-deeper litter depth (right now it can only allow for 3-4cm of litter depth and its seems like our cats would like to bury their waste a little deeper-quieter cleaning cycles (but a more flexible cleaning time cycle would make this point moot if we were gone for the day or asleep)-smaller total size, although the litter bowl size is about perfectSo, if you have the initial $330 for a litter box and want it to be automatic, then this thin is awesome and I highly recommend it. However, if your mission is to save money, then it doesn't make sense as a purchase.Hope this was helpful!",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,648

I had purchased the pink version for my daughter at a yard sale when she was about one year old (now 3) and she still loves to play with it. She puts her animals and such in the front and then gets in for a ride. My son always wanted to get in her car, so I thought we would get him one so they could each have their own. It pushes easily on our driveway and around our neighborhood. I put both of my kids in their cars and I can push them side by side at the same time. We pretend they are racing each other and they love that. Both of my kids hold onto the steering wheel and pretend to drive and both can honk the horn (pushes easily, which can sometimes be a problem with children's toys/cars). I don't know how well this would push in grass, but I can't imagine it would be too difficult. Easy enough to put together, and overall seems pretty durable. I know they had recalled some of the older versions due to the part that holds the handle on (they shipped us a new part and we have had no issues), but they have fixed that problem with this version. I tilt the handle back so that the front two wheels come up off the ground and the kids enjoy that as well. The only issue that some might have (I personally don't have a problem with this) is that the front wheels don't swivel, so you have to tilt the car back to turn it sharp.

( be careful not to go near your eyebrows )wowww i am saving alot of money by no more threadingBy the way i bought it from bed bath and beyond and used a coupon and got it cheaper than here.but thanks amazon customers for the reviews that helped me to buy it.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,419

It could also become an 'acquired taste'. A friend of mine started off hating even a hint of stevia in his tea... then became gradually accustomed to it after white sugar was banned by his health practitioner.

It is extremely light and well made. It is the second lightest transporter wheelchair out there. It's so easy to collapse and open. I particularly liked that fact that it is 17"" wide rather than the standard 19"". My mother is very thin so this was fine. I just thought it's hard enough to get through doorways as it is, the narrower (if the person can fit in it) the better. DO take that into consideration! The only other transporter that is lighter than this one is made from Medline, called the featherlite transporter (or something like that) at under 15lbs...but it is 19"" wide. This wheelchair is 19 lbs and it still felt really light to me. I'm only 5'3"" tall, and I had no trouble pushing my mom around.I bought this chair along with a cushion. DO get a cushion because transporter chairs don't have much support for the tushie. The other thing to be aware of are the foot rest. They do flop around once you fold up the chair. I recommend getting a small zippered nylon tote bag that is small enough to hold the foot rest and store in the back chair's pocket when not in use. The foot rests are very easy to remove. But they can fall out when not in use. So get a small carrying bag for them.The nylon fabric is sturdy and well-made.

I am also a sports med. doctor and treat amateur and professional athletes. I can attest to the fact that you need a good knowledge of kinesiology and biomechanics to maximize the effects of this tape. The tape can be used to facilitate and inhibit muscle function, mechanically correct joint and soft tissue issues, functionally correct impaired movement patterns, and is great for lymph/circulation issues.The problem nowadays is that every runner/triathlete/athlete want to go out and buy this tape, or Rocktape, and slap it on. Mind you, if it's applied incorrectly, you risk significant damage to your body. For example, if you wish to facilitate a muscle and you end up inhibiting it, you can do yourself a lot of harm, especially over the course of a sporting event.It's best to see a CKTP before you play around with this stuff. Unless you know your anatomy and kinesiology at a very high level, this tape should not be used. Sure, people don't want to see a professional as it means taking time, a co-pay, etc...but, being you can alter the function of your musculoskeletal system, it's probably worth it to know the correct application of the tape for your issue(s) before you do something that could potentially create harm.Just my two cents.",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,braces,220

27318,B00000EE9Z,Positive Vibrations,A2YKHC0EJAA5CZ,0/0,5.0,1295481600,"A lot of people pan this 1974 album, but this is Ten Years After returning to their roots -- and doing it superbly.After Woodstock, everybody got Alvin Lee fever, but TYA'S sound was NEVER a one-man-act. I own all of Lee's post-TYA stuff, and he's never yet put out anything that can touch the TYA stuff as far as I'm concerned. Although ""Zoom"" is darn good.That's because TYA was a BAND, where each individual player was a master of their own instrument and played their own material for each song, with the product jelling as music.What's nice about this CD is that the mixes and arrangements allow each instrument equal presence -- just like it was on ""Cricklewood Green"" and ""Watt"" -- not consistently shoving the guitar out front, but making sure it's there when it's got the lead spot.If I had to compare the sound and style of ""Positive Vibrations"" I would call it a mix between ""Watt"" and ""A Space in Time"" -- truly, two classic TYA albums.It has the excellent timing changes within the body of songs like ""Watt,"" and great use of acoustic guitar like ""A Space in Time.""Bass, keyboard, and drums consistently play distinctive elements of the songs, not just background reference for the lead guitar.Speaking of which, Lee's work on this album is -- there's no other words for it -- superbly tasteful. He's not trying to show off at all, but works his notes into intricate patterns that, again, are reminiscent of ""Watt.""Although 1972's ""Rock N Roll Music to the World"" is an excellent album, the sound, mix, and production on that album was and is too Alvin Lee-focused, but with ""Positive Vibrations"" it is the band playing as the band again -- cleanly, and doing it well.As for the lyrics, they're written with the same flavor and level of skill that any of Lee's other stuff ever was. I like them. He's a guitarist, not Wordsworth.Anyway, if you listen to this album and think ""Watt"" and ""A Space in Time,"" and enjoy TYA's jazz/blues rock fusion material, you'll find this album grows on you.It is really very, very good, and it is a sad statement of the times -- then, and now -- that the legend of Alvin Lee's blistering fingers still overshadow the last great effort the full band put out in their original days.If you dust this baby off, I think you'll find a true Ten Years After gem.It does not appear to be remastered, however. Neither BGO's website, nor the CD make that statement. Only the Amazon.com description. But the sound is still excellent because the original was done properly.Enjoy.",health personal care,sexual wellness,unknown,441
1674,B00005QXPE,Safety 1st On-the-Go Fold-Up Booster Seat,unknown,11/11,4.0,1062720000,"I guess to each their own. I have come to the conclusion after reading thousands of reviews on products that some people are never satisfied and will find the smallest thing to gripe about. I REALLY like this seat. My best friend had one and bought one for me after her son got sick from eating in a restaurant highchair. I already had an older seat that was a pain to use because it was in a million pieces and took forever to put together. This seat is 1 piece, 2 if you count the tray. It is compact, portable, light, and takes up hardly any space in my trunk and has a place to put your fingers to carry. The tray snaps on the underside and the straps wind-up into the seat. Have my straps twisted inside...yes, but they fixed themselves and did not pose a threat to my child. Does the tray fit tight..yes, but atleast the food doesn't fall down in his lap. My child doesn't have a big stomach, so the tray isn't too tight on him. Sometimes, I leave the tray off and let him eat off of the table or a plate. The clips on my tray have not broken, but my friends did and they sent her a new tray. The flap/compartment is very shallow but can hold a bib or two. Mine has never popped open like some have complained about. The legs are not hard to put in place, and they add a nice height to the chair. Now, a complaint by a reviewer that has bothered me is..the seat doesn't remove to clean....HELLO....If you go to fold the seat, you can fit a napkin, sponge whatever down there and wipe all of the crumps out (if there are any) and wipe down the seat. If your straps are dirty, take a soapy sponge to those too. I take this seat everywhere with me and would be soooo lost without it. We had a playgroup the other day with 7 moms and 8 kids and I kid you not...ALL 7 OF US CARRIED IN THE EXACT SAME SEAT....THIS ONE!!!! We all laughed and commented on how much we liked this seat!!!!",baby products,feeding,highchairs booster seats,370

With a little Epsom Salts, which you may use with this, this does the trick. When I first got in the tub, and had to wrestle with the mat to keep it down, I was doubting my purchase, but once I got settled, it was very relaxing and enjoyable. Some reviewers stated that the water doesn't stay hot. It says that in the literature, and I found that if I stay in it for the recommended 15-20 minutes, it stays hot enough.

In fact, the use of this product has actually interferred with my past complete vitamin program.In my opinion, Green Vibrance is an incomplete product. For example, the only ""B"" vitamin included is B12 and only at 44% daily value. What happened to the other ""B"" vitamins. One deletion that affects us all, especially men, is the exclusion of zinc. The calcium and magnesium amounts are severly lower than optimum values and not in the accepted ratios of 2 to 1. The manufacturer also omitted amino acids.The real problem lies in the fact that the product does contain threshold amounts of Vitamin A and 2.5 times the threshold of Vitamin D. This prevents someone from supplementing with a multi-vitamin because that would put A and D over the recommended dosages. The only way I see to have a balanced vitamin and mineral regimen while taking this product is to purchase individual Calcium and Magnesium, Zinc, and B complex vitamins. Does one really need or want 25 billion probiotics daily? I'm not so sure I want that everyday.

It whipes well for simple messes, and comes of easily for more thorough washes in the washing machine. I love the reclining features, which especially came in handy when he was younger and would sometimes fall asleap in the chair. I also love that the chair adjusts up and down to so many levels, making in easy on Mom and Dad's back and safe for my son who now loves to climb in and out of his chair. The large tray makes it great for using the chair for so many activities such as arts and crafts and puzzles. And the tray is simple to put on and off with one hand. I also love that my son hasn't figured out how to take the tray off by himself yet, which he has with the chair at my parent's house. The chair is also very easy to fold up and take along on trips. And being on wheels makes it easy to move to any area of the house. My bigest complaint is that my parents had tried to purchase this chair several times, and each time there was a defect with the arms. The tray wouldn't go on right. I think it was probably a problem with shipping and handling or how the store was storing the boxes that bent the arms out of place.

That cost would be fine if you could be certain that the money was unequivocally buying you some additional level of safety.After months of steady research I didn't feel that these more expensive organic cribs were necessarily safer and in fact, was worried about the paucity of customer testimonial associated with them.When it came down to it we relied on the numerous positive reviews on Amazon as well as the endorsement of Consumer Reports (this model was an editor's choice on Consumer Reports' list.)I read a review just now where a couple claimed to have put the crib together in 25 minutes. That must have looked like a NASCAR pit stop, I have no idea how someone could put it together that quickly - good for them.I assembled it solo and it took a couple hours, though I wasn't rushing and was double and triple checking the tightness of each bolt. I also spent some time leveling the mattress spring system.The best thing I can say about the assembly is that there is no point at which you'll be frustrated. Frequently in putting together something with as many parts as this, you'll encounter some trouble despite your being sure you are following the directions correctly (think IKEA assembly).

Even with seemingly no detectable breeze on the ground this hi flier will drift sideways a good amount on its descent, if they used a parachute on this model it would drift sideways for miles! Also, the super ultra lightweight of the rocket coupled with the powerful C6 engine will make a perfectly vertical take off virtually impossible, so all the more reason for large launch area. The excitement and unpredictability of these rockets is the fun factor of them. My kids were more excited finally finding the rocket than the blast off aspect.

4625,B000099Z9K,Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,A3U4MQ1IK6JREO,2/2,3.0,1124064000,"We purchased this seat for our daughter prior to her birth because it was rated well, would grow with her and it is a nice looking seat with plush fabric. HOWEVER, installing it in the middle of our full sized Chevy Impala back seat was a nightmare. It took a bed pillow folded in half to equal out the seat angle and it still is not tipped back enough because it is resting on the back of the front seats and can't go any further. At 4 months old, there is too much room on either side of my daughter (she slouches and leans even while harnessed down)and I had to remove their head rest and add another because she was too tall, but still needed the support. And, the WORST part is that the angle of the seat itself is 90 degrees or less, so when she's in it, her legs are practically on her belly which is much too sharp of a bent position for a baby this young. I can't imagine having brought her home from the hospital in it. A recent trip to Babies R' Us shows that the seat is already redesigned with side support pillows and a new easier restraint lock (which I'll call and order from Dorel). It hasn't even been 6 months since we bought our seat though, which is dissapointing. On that trip to the store, we bought the Britax Decathlon. We put her in it at the store and it has all of the support and safety we were hoping for.

I read an article in the Boston Globe about how most name-brand baby products are actually filled with toxic chemicals including formaldehyde. I decided I wasn't going to expose my baby to these types of toxins, even if it was going to cost me a bit more. I checked the Environmental Working Group's skin deep website at [...] and was shocked to see that even products that advertise themselves as being wonderful and natural - like Aveeno - are filled with toxins that can alter hormone levels or lead to allergies.We'd been using Burt's Bees previously, and it isn't the worst, but this was much purer. I was sad to see that, because if you can't fully trust Burt's Bees to be super-good for you, what can you trust? I'll probably still use the Burt's on myself, but not on baby.Luckily, EMAB products really don't break the bank given how long they last, are pretty easy to find on Amazon (unlike many of the best options on the EWG site). I am a convert, and hope more people start using products like this and putting pressure on the big companies like Johnson and Johnson and Proctor and Gamble to shape up or ship out!",baby products,bathing skin care,skin care,215

The wagon is fairly simple to put together, the extra long handle is great, the wheels are quiet and turn great and the wagon itself is very large also!!! I can't imagine how big those other ones are (the family deluxe, etc. that Radio Flyer offer-they must be enormous!)

They are consistent in size and shape (which should not be surprising in blocks, but surprisingly it is) so building complex towers, including ones that can be loudly dismantled by selecting the single point of failure.

The walkers in the stores were at least $200, some up to $400.I looked online at Amazon and finally found this one. I was a little hesitant because of the low price that it would be a piece of junk. But, I received it within 5 days, it was easy to put together, it adjusts to my mother's tiny frame, and she really, really likes it. It folds fairly easily and fits in a back seat or trunk of my Toyota sedan. It has a handy little basket under the seat. It has hand brakes, which she had to get used to, but the breaks also lock and unlock easily for support when she's standing or if she wants to rest for a while on the seat.This walker was definitely a bargain, and very high quality.

I told her that I had tried the night before, and she said that they were having phone problems that night. So, I went home, and tried calling again. Still not open after 6. So I got the model number, and called again from work. Mind you, each time you call, you have to wait for at least 10 or 15 minutes on hold until you get someone. I finally got another person, who told me that I now need the date code. So back home, check the date code, and call back during work again next day. ""Sorry, that's the wrong date code."" I needed to open up the cover for the computer chip and pull it out. The number was written on the chip in pen. I also took the unit apart to find out what was actually wrong with it. There is a cheap plastic gear inside the mechanism that got bent, and that is what was causing the problem. So, I called back today. Finally, they told me that I had to cut the computer chip off, and send that with a check for $10 to their company for shipping and handling, and they would send me a new unit. I asked for a supervisor, and was told that I was talking to one. I told her that the product is junk, and that the service is horrible. She said she was sorry to hear that, and I hung up.

I am also planning to give Schylling tea sets as gifts to other girls, and it is on my list to give my little niece (now 2 months) as soon as she is old enough for her first tea set.Another final, excellent point in favor of this tea set is that it is inexpensive and widely available, so replacement pieces will not be a problem.

Also, smaller poop and clumped urine falls through the sifter and doesn't get included in the removable scoop. There is always small amounts of poop and clumped urine floating around in the box even after being rolled and cleaned. Other than that, we haven't had any real problems.

And unless Toy Biz is now stocking the varaints 3 to every one standard figure, the Black one is the variant. In several stores I've seen 3 or 4 in the Purple outfit, and only 1, if any, in the black. Some of this confusion proably stems from the card back. The figure pictured there is much closer to the black version, but closer inspection reveals it's not actually either. The body sculpt is identical for both figures, it is the heads and paint ops that are different. The pictured X is most likely an earlier prototype. (There is even a discalimer to that effect on the card back right next to the UPC code.) The Bishop variant doesn't have the scarf pictured on the card back, and the Iron Fist is flipped (the dragon is going the wrong way, as well as the hands being on the wrong sides). The graphic designer's either made a mistake or were working from earlier versions of the figures, either way, Purple X is much more common.As I previously stated, both X-23's use an identical body sculpt.The purple version's head scuplt with the wilder hair, and expression give her a much more feral look. I believe the eyes are supposed to be brown, like Wolverine's. In the included comic book Nightcrawler observes that their eyes are identical.The Black version has straighter hair, and a much colder and dangerous look about her.

Also, I suspect there is alittle bit of quality control issues, and sometimes you'll find someone got a lemon.That being said, this is a fun little gun that I purchased to keep the hordes of code toads (aka programmers) from overrunning my cube at work.It's not the best nerf gun ever, heck the Hasbro Nerf N-Strike Maverick, listed on amazon for 1/3 of the price is probably the best non-modded handgun you can buy atm.This one lacks power, and it'd be smarter to buy a $5 bottle of glow in the dark paint than attach these stickers (which lose sticky fast and then just jam up the darts in the tubes).The action is good but not for super fast shooting, I use the sonic or velcro darts mostly (painted for night action) and they work much better.all in all, its a decent little gun, if you want 20ft+ I'd suggest googling 'nerf mods' and buying a dremel/ton of super glue, because while they could've made this gun alot better, I suppose they could've made it alot worse as well.My suggestion, buy a Hasbro Nerf N-Strike Maverick, follow some of the easy mods, and have a nice concealable longer shooting gun for alot less money.Nerf on!",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play,271

Within a week, my son had nipple confusion and I was exclusively pumping. I went back to these bottles in an attempt to get him to breastfeed again and they were a lifesaver!

I have tried several different bottles since then (my son is now 9 months) and the only bottle other than this he will take is Avent (and those leak!!.) I love these bottles mainly because they were the only reason I was able to breastfeed my son but also because they are wider than other bottle which makes cleaning super easy, they don't leak, the top of the bottle fits on the bottom of the bottle while you are feeding (super convenient so you don't lose it!) and the 9 ounce bottles actually hold more than 9 ounces (I mix the formula in his bottle and when you put 9 ounces of water and the scoops of formula on top, many other bottles overflow).

4238,B00005BTNA,Playtex VentAire ADVANCED BPA Free Wide Bottles - 3 Pack,A1OUNBSMSTLVSC,1/1,5.0,1118966400,"With my daughter (now 3) she would take almost ANY bottle, any nipple, and never have ANY gaseous problems. With my now 9 month old twin sons, they are VERY picky ""nursers"".The ventairs didnt leak, didnt spill, and were easy to clean... but the boys just HATED them. My husband went to buy more, since we were really running low on the 5 bottles we had that the boys would use (ventairs, they would use em', but they didnt like it!) And he had ""accidently"" came home with the Natural shaped nipples... My boys LOVED them. We didnt realize it was a different nipple until we examined the box to go pick up more, the nipple did the trick!As for the bottle itself, I have always loved them. Its easy to pour milk into (some bottles have too small of an opening) and they are easy to ""set up"". You just grab a bottle (the clear plastic ""body"") Find a base and screw it on TIGHTLY (the thing that looks like its part of a gas mask) and than attatch a nipple. The bases and nipple rings come in different colors, but I have never found them to ""not work"" on all ventairs... What I mean is the natural nipple rings can fit on the bottles that came with the regular nipples and so on... and it doesnt matter if the base and nipple rings are the same color or from the same set (everyone probablly knows this, but just adding in my 2 cents). I found ours to NEVER leak if we had it on right... On those occasional nightly feedings (you know, when your half awake?) that we would set it up wrong and it would leak, our fault entirely... NOT the bottles. I also LOVE that there are different shaped nipples, and they all work with ALL of the ventair bottles, so you can purchase new ones if yours ""wear out"" (although they seem to be much tougher than the avents that my daughter used) and you can purchase a whole different set of nipples if your child doesnt like the ones you have, its really a trial and error thing. I also love how easy it is to clean them. It sounds like it would be a pain to have to clean a base, a body, a nipple, and a ring of 2x the bottles right? WRONG. This makes it super easy and convinient to clean... With other bottles we would have to dig and scrub the bottom, and sometimes we would just toss a bottle because the bottom was too disgusting. With the Ventairs you dont have this problem. We have a double sink, and keep warm, soapy water on one side, and just rinse off a bottle and throw it in. Than at the end of the day we take them all out and rinse them off, (and make sure theres nothing left inside of them) and place them in the sterelizer or the dishwasher... EASY... I swear this would be IMPOSSIBLE without the 4 parts to the ventair, if you did that with a regular bottle, you would end up with GROSS bottles, you would definatly have to scrub EACH BOTTLE for about 4 minutes to get everything out... Whats even ""cooler"" is that it actually helps with preventing gas and spit-ups... My sons are coliky, and they have ALWAYS haved gas and spit up problems, we never thought this would be a problem that we could solve, but along came the Ventairs and POOF, hardly EVER do we have gas problems? Now that the boys are eating solids, these bottles have still proven to be worth their weight in gold! They are easy for a baby to hold, and they dont have the tilt thier head back all the way since teh ventairs shape takes care of that! My nice is 16 months old now and even HER ventairs can handle drops, tantrums, rattling in the diaper bag all day, and various kinds of drinks and they NEVER leak, and NEVER break... Its like ""super bottle"".I cant imagine how many minutes we save each day with the ventairs, even if you have a bottle that ""works"", and your baby does fine with it, purchase a few ventairs, they will save you precious time... hey, they are only this size for so long right?",baby products,feeding,bottle feeding,731

I looked at the price of good standard blades, though, and saw how quickly an electric razor would pay for itself. I'll never go back. For the first week, the shave was not as close as I had become accustomed with using a blade. After that, though, I've gotten closer and closer shaves by the week. After a little more than a month of using the Spectra, my skin is now smooth even against the grain. I've gotten back to where I was with a blade.The Pros:- Shaving takes easily only half the time as it did with a straight razor.- I can shave any time, any where. With a blade, if I tried to shave more than once per day, I'd cut myself all up into a bloody mess. With this electric, I do notice some discomfort after having shaved a second time in a day, but it gets a nice close shave. A little after shave takes care of the sting, and I'm good to go again.- No mess. I really don't miss having to use shaving cream, even my nifty hot-lather shaving cream.The Cons:- Motor power seems to wind down a bit towards the end of the battery charge. It's not too bad, but it seems to take longer to shave at the end of the charge, and I don't want to charge it early for fear of damaging the battery.- This is really a minor quibble, but I thought I'd mention it",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,294

I still use the Bare Minerals eyeshadows, as they don't bother my eyes. If you have problems with acne and use this makeup, I would try switching to a pharmaceutical grade makeup and see what happens.And as a side note.... stop using Tide laundry detergent if you have chronic breakouts. It contains a lot of residue that can make you break out. I now use Dreft on all my pillow cases, sheets and towels I use to dry my body and face.

12760,B00005BXKM,The First Years Quick Serve Bottle Warmer,AO8HJ8MZKPUWC,6/6,4.0,1202688000,"I'm quite convinced now that late pregnancy and early post-partum are probably the worst periods of time to try to figure out gadgets that don't have clear instructions. In my case, although there was a warning that a basket should always be used in the warmer, my brain erased that comment with the subsequent paragraph that said wide mouth bottles don't require the lift out basket. To be clearer, in both places it should say that the large basket is always required (otherwise you are heating the bottle directly on the plate and also in boiling water... both of which are no-nos.The instructions are also too simplistic. The type of bottle one uses (shape, size, material) will very dramatically affect how the heat from the steam impacts the solution being heated. I would also imagine that some further tweaking will be required as the composition of breastmilk changes during the day and over the course of the post partum period.For example, I used 9 oz MAM Ultivent (BPA free) translucent bottles that are wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. In my successful experiment with water chilled in the fridge to about 40 F, I needed to add 2x the max level in the provided measuring tube to get the water up to about 80 F. The unit was on for about 6 minutes until the water all vaporized. This is more than 2x the amount generally recommended in the instruction sheet and the sticker plastered to the side of the unit has even less detail.Note that if you make the mistake of running the unit without any basket, some overheat sensor will trip before the water is completely used up after about a minute or so.Given that there is unlikely any product out there which monitors the temp of the solution being heated (or is otherwise aware of what kind of bottle/solution combo is in place), trial and error and patience will be required with any such product. Life will probably be easier for formula babies since formula doesn't change over time!Good luck!p.s. a water softener with regular applications of rust-inhibitor solution, or the use of distilled water will probably reduce the amount of cleaning required.

I say this because the quality of the screws is so substandard that I would venture to guess that few of these chairs ever assembled actually have the requisite number of properly torsioned screws to make the chairs stable and likely to last. The pity is that such substandard screws (screw heads can break off or the inserts can be rounded) routinely found in similar materials made in Romania 20 years ago, now resurface with the same outcome.

I will admit the copper head seemed warmer than the stone head but neither one felt like it got hot enough to really feel nice on sore muscles. The vibration head, which is the rectangular piece you see, has a soft squish pad on top. Which is nice but the vibrations aren't strong enough to go through this pad, and it doesn't heat up either.The product itself comes with three heads, a copper head, a stone head and a massaging head that has a nice squishy pad on its head. The copper and stone head heat up and the massaging head is for the vibrations it does not heat up. One great thing about the massage is its swivel wand.

You can color both sides but it is difficult to match sides.

My cat actually loves the litterlocker and will sit at her litterbox each morning waiting for it to be cleaned for the day.I've heard of of those ""electronic"" messy litterboxes and didn't want to get stuck cleaning out the rakes and such. The litter locker is a sanitary way to keep kitty's litterbox odor and lump free. The litterlocker is so easy to use, scoop, deposit in the ""fresh bag"" and twist the side handle to ""get rid of"" your kitty waste. Once a week we empty the litter locker and have never had it break or leak even once. With the waste wrapped in plastic it's odor-free and very easy to take out to the garbage can with no problems at all.The ultimate compliment is having people come to my house and be surprised when our kitty comes out to greet them - saying that they usually smell that ""cat smell"" when they enter a ""cat"" house and they didn't smell that in our house at all.

Even though he's now into Bionicle and Legos, my 7-year-old son still plays with them, and builds some remarkably complex machines and robots, all with suitably complex functions he is happy to demonstrate.In the beginning, as a preschooler, he needed a little help building the featured creations, but I was amazed at how quickly he was able to follow the illustrations all by himself -- which gave me a little break and made him proud! Most of the different types of rods and connectors are color-coded, for example, green rods are longer than yellow, and red rods are flexible; and the illustrations are carefully angled and in color so that he could see every piece needed, and all he had to do was match the colors. It built confidence and gave him experience following directions before he could read. And, once he found that he didn't have to stick with just the illustrated creations, there was no stopping him!The pieces are very sturdy, and, with the exception of the small blue rods, big enough that we had no worries about his younger siblings getting into them.

21603,B000MKHQG4,"CatGenie-Self Washing, Self Flushing Cat Box",AZAGAAPYPBJTY,1/1,1.0,1264464000,"In short, do not buy this product. I got this as a Christmas present, and I wish the money had been spent better (like on something useful). First, the cat genie toilet is enormous. It takes up much more space than a regular litter box, and since it requires an electrical outlet, water intake, and water drainage, you are very limited to where you can keep it. My only option is the bathroom, where it takes up about half of the free space. It's like a little space ship is parked in front of my toilet. It won't fit next to the toilet cause it is GIGANTIC. Oh, and the power cord is only about 5 feet long, so you'll need an extension cord like me if you don't have an outlet right next to your water supply and drain. Next, the reusable granules are just like regular cat litter, they will get tracked all over your house from your cat's paws. So you'll have to spend $[...] to replace them more often than the claimed 4-6 months unless you walk around with a broom and try to scoop them all and put them back in (so you still have to scoop something). Additionally, it requires a $[...] cleaning solution. I cannot verify the 240 wash claim on cat setting but it will run out very quick if it runs every time it is used. If you only turn it on yourself it runs for 25 minutes and only lasts for ""120 washes"". It uses an excessive amount of electricity and water. My utility bill after 1 month was unbelievable. You may get a ""self washing litter box"" as claimed, but you certainly pay for it. Between the cleaning solution, granules, and utilities to run it, you are spending a lot more than you would on regular kitty litter. It also is very loud, it's like there is a blender on for 25 minutes. Finally, it makes my whole house smell like a public restroom. After the cat genie is done washing the granules it blows them dry with hot air, a LOT of hot air, and it blows the smell of urine out along with the moisture. Sure, I don't have to scoop any poop, but I sure do have to breath vaporized urine for an hour after it runs. To sum it up",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,395

My cat at the time was pregnant, she had her kittens Tuesday Sept 7, 2010. I kept my cat in my room a few days so she could calm down and get use to the move. Finally, I let her roam the house and she was fine until she came in contact with the dog. She growled and hissed, attacked and then ran, the dog didn't back down but also did not bark, scratch or bite. The next day she was lying close to the dog with no problem. The morning after, Sept 5, 2010 my dog was put to sleep. The only ones left were the cats. Unfortunately, unlike the dog after she encountered the cats she didn't become friends after they growled and snapped at each other. Actually, after she had her kittens she even started to bully one cat. She would seek him out and attack. It has gotten to the point where the other cats are afraid to eat or roam around the house. I just got the bottle of At ease Thur Sept 9, 2010. My mother and I lost sleep over the random attacks from my cat in the middle of the night. I sprayed it everywhere. I was hoping it would relax them enough to where they can at least not attack each other. It did not work for my cat at all. So, she is now confined to my room.The reason why I gave it an two stars is because one cat is a scaredy cat. The funny thing about him is he is a main coon (in other words huge) yet he hides. Since I sprayed, ""At Ease"", he doesn't run from my cat anymore. He hid majority of the time and only came out to eat and as soon as he heard my door open, he would disappear. Once I sprayed, ""At Ease"", he stopped hiding and was acting like normal. He still growls at my cat, when she growls at him but he isn't in hiding anymore. Too bad I can't get the one she picks on, out of hiding and he is the friendly cat, who loves everybody.Since, it has only been a day for me, I am still going to continue using and update my review if there is any changes. I am thinking maybe the cats were so stressed from the loss of my dog and the cat fights and new kittens that maybe the, ""At Ease"" isn't strong enough to calm them down at this time. I will see...It is Sept 19, 2010 and I sprayed the At Ease all over the house for a few more days to see if there were any difference. I stopped using it because it seemed pointless. The main coon still picks up for myself so it is uncertain if it were from the spray or just him having enough of her taking over.",pet supplies,cats,health supplies,511

I go this because I tried my friend's and I loved it. I felt like there wasn't much pressure on my back, and I could be hands free without worrying. The bad thing about the whole style of carriers is that the baby is close, but detached at the same time. They must feel like they are in some kind of contraption, just hanging there. I have a sling (adjusting ring) form maya wrap, and its good, but there is just too many pressure points on me, and I find myself adusting it all the time. I have not tried backpacks but they look odd, heavy, and too expensive anyway. So any mom out there looking for a good carrier, I suggest the european made (german I believe) DiDimos. Its a huge peice of fabric, that you use to wrap around and tie the baby to you. The baby can feel close, comfortable, be in alot of different positions, and grow into it (bjorn is good for about 7 months). Many moms that have tried slings may find them uncomfy, but this is totally different. there is not rings or adjusting things, beacuse there is no need for them, and it wraps around you forming an x at your back to relieve pressure. The baby feels totally secure (no hands) unlike other slings that may feel like they are slipping. It also looks great and is a nice blanky when you need one. Its pricy (search for deals) but you can just make your own with the right fabric.

There are a lot of pieces and a lot of screws, and it took a good hour and a half to assemble. I followed the directions to the letter (which were very clear and easy to understand- the only good part of the entire thing). The fact that the screw holes were not properly aligned for the pieces added to my frustration, and made assembly considerably more difficult to accomplish. The finished product is a truck that looks like it came out of a Picasso painting. Most of the parts don't line up right and are crooked, and the back of the truck where the ""garbage"" is dumped is loose and wobbly when it is raised up. The little garbage receptacle that attaches to the back of the truck is held on by Velcro dots, but it doesn't hang on very well because the two pieces barely touch each other.

I have somewhat dry, color-treated hair in a neutral red shade that was fading fast. This particular color gave me the coppery deep red I like, without the weird purple tint of some other red dyes I have tried. In addition, this is the shiniest my hair has been after coloring. The smell is pleasant. I will definitely use this again, but I will do a few things differently next time because I found the product to be extremely messy. Next time I think I will shampoo and towel dry like the instructions say, but I think I will actually put the product on my hair in the shower and sit out the 25 minutes there. This stuff is very drippy and even though I was careful, I wound up with droplets here there and everywhere. I put on a clear disposable cap that helped a little, but still - very messy and that's coming from an experienced ""bathroom chemist"" who has used a lot of hair coloring.I left the product on for 25 minutes as directed and I rinsed but did not let the water run completely clear. It's a little trick I do to ""set"" the color so it lasts longer. Once I had most of the product out and the water still had a little tint still showing, I put on my regular cheapo conditioner, rinsed it out and blew my hair dry. I was pleased that the color didn't ""grab"" on the ends of my hair and make them too dark like some other products have done.

After looking at a number of websites that featured good stools with handles, I found the average price of one that could accommodate a 200+ person ran between $50 - $80. I fully expected I'd be returning this given that the price differential was so great but it turned out not to be so at all. I did have a problem installing one screw/bolt and, hard as I tried, I couldn't line the holes in the handle with the matching holes in the base. Since I'm not necessarily a ""handy woman"", that may have been an issue someone else might not have a problem with. I ended up inserting the screw as far as I could and leaving it at that. I did take some extra precautions though since I'd be using this stool almost every day in my closet. What I did was to wrap two of those plastic ties that lock into place around each of the two handle/stool base connection areas. This probably wasn't necessary but I just didn't want any stress on the area where the handle joined the base.The only drawback I can see is that you need to remember to have the handle positioned to the left or right to step up onto the stool because if you place the handle in front, the stool base area that you position your feet on is narrow. You can certainly use it with the handle in front but I felt more comfortable knowing there was plenty of room for both my feet. If the foot area was a square rather than a rectangle, it would be helpful since you would have plenty of foot space no matter how you wanted to place the support handle. Overall, I'd recommend this item because I found it to be very good quality for such a low price.

Since then, both he and his nine-year-old sister have played with the Snap Circuits set several times. I'm particularly impressed with the set because my son doesn't have the longest of attention spans, and I didn't know if he would be interested enough to remain focused on completion of a project on his own. I've been pleasantly surprised.The tasks start out easy and increase in complexity as you move through the projects in the instruction book. The pieces are labeled clearly, which makes it easy for my son to see what he needs next. I think part of the reason he remains interested is that he sees the payoff such as a light or alarm coming on, music being played when he claps or makes a noise, or flicking a switch to move from a light to a noise. I very much like the snap feature, because the pieces are easy for my kids to attach or take apart without my assistance.As for the educational aspect, the instruction book contains some explanations and ""now try this"" suggestions. Unless my husband or I work on the project with my son, he tends to gloss right over the explanations.

Some place, some event..something? Well, as soon as I opened it, the first thing that popped in my mind was the Zoo People.One of the most famous zoos in the country were also my customers and occasionally, some members of the Zoo staff would come in. We could smell them 20 feet away - that 'wild animal' smell.As I melted this onto my skin and sniffed it, I had to laugh, picturing my giving off some scent that attracted every male water buffalo around..chasing me down the street!Anyway, luckily, the scent dissipated as did my goofy thinking - ha! Truly, it doesn't smell bad at all..it just smells 'natural' and a bit 'wild'. I mixed in some coconut oil; and will try a bit and mix in some other oils, maybe some essential oils and see how that goes.The price was good; shipping and delivery and presentation good.

30712,B0002D31QU,Petsafe Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar,AROPLQ2GH72E,0/0,5.0,1310428800,"Thought I would review this product, as we've been using the collar for about 2 weeks now. Lucky is a 7 yr old yellow lab (my girlfriends). We've just moved into a house together and noticed the dog was extremely thirsty, especially when we arrived home. Doctor gave her a clean bill of health, so on a hunch we decided to video the dog while we were gone and it turns out she was barking nonstop while we were away (8 hours when left that long). Having spent the last 5 years in a large house with a lot of space between the houses, my girlfriend couldn't completely discount the notion that Lucky has been doing this for years. Lucky would be barking when she would arrive home each day, but she attributed it to the automatic garage door opening (the preferred way to enter that house).Well, the new place is a large row home in the city. Even though the neighbors haven't contacted us via note or face to face, I'm sure we are not held in high regards at this point. I know they can hear her. We tried crating her, which she is very familiar with, but that would only grant us about 1 hour of quiet before the bombardment of anxiety filled yelps and barks would commence relentlessly till we arrived back home. We decided to go with the Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar because it wasn't a shock collar, and it would work while we were away. When we are home, Lucky only barks to alert us of someone at the door, or loud unusual noises.It was easy to set up, load, fit and we were in business in under 5 minutes. We decided to go out for dinner and thought we'd give the dog about 2 1/2 - 3 hours of time to get acquainted with our the system. While the laptop video ran, we had a great dinner up the street and drinks with friends. We arrived home to see what happened while we were gone via the laptop video. After we left, Lucky paced nervously back and forth, hit the collar box on a wooden chair arm and got sprayed for no reason. Although it was funny, it's not teaching her anything. So after a few minutes of confusion, she started barking for us to return only to receive a blast in front of her face of citronella spray. She looked around trying to figure out who just sprayed her. She changed locations in the room and tried barking again. Blast #2. Walked to another corner of the room, bark, blast #3. upstairs, bark, blast #4. How about a howl instead, blast #5. She then retired to her crate to avoid this unpleasant phenomenon and was quiet till our return. All of this took place in the first 20 minutes of our leaving the house.That was about 2 weeks ago. We've stopped setting up the webcam video while we are gone. Not only has Lucky stopped anxiety barking, but she seems much, much calmer now. The last couple of videos showed her wandering the house, sniffing around, goofing with the cats, and napping either in her crate (door open) or on her dog bed.It worked perfectly as advertised. She only wears it while we are away and we all are much happier.",pet supplies,dogs,collars,561

It just includes some skin and perhaps bone.)Apparently the food is palatable and tasty to dogs.It's made in the USAThe maker guarantees your satisfaction.Wilderness Blend food contains dried POTATOES!Because the food is so nutritionally dense, you can feed your dog a little less than a lesser food.

Finally, if my back or other joints are hurting, I take it for inflammation. I'm pretty careful to stick within the 6 caplet max suggested on the bottle but there have been times when I've gone over. One benefit I find is that when I take it for allergy symptoms, the anti-inflammatory properties soothe the tissues of my sinuses and calm down the stuffiness as well as the headache I sometimes get from the sinus thing. Within a week of this being suggested by my doctor, I was able to stop using Claratin completely. It's nice to know that something so natural (it's made from the skins of red apples and red onions) can work so well with none of the side effects or drug interactions from the normal drugs (sleepiness and worse).

His grandparents purchased this when my son was about ten months old, hoping it would encourage him to start walking. My son seemed to have a hard time using this toy as a walker while he was starting out and still somewhat off balance. The problem we encountered was that when using this toy in the walker mode, there is no way to control the speed in which to toy moves away from the child. When my son would hold onto the top and try to pull himself up, the toy would roll away before he could get his balance, thus making him fall back down. Also, there did not seem to be enough room within the ""V"" formed by the two back pieces (where the child is supposed to stand) for my son to be comfortable. Basically, he was quickly discouraged with this toy as a walker and would not play with it. We ended up purchasing a more basic walker (Fisher Price Activity Walker - also at Toys R Us and discounted at the time but since then no longer in stock) that he was able to use with much more success.That being said, now that he is able to walk without assistance, we have converted this toy to the ride on mode and he goes back to it time and again to sit on. He has not yet figured out how to make it move forward by pushing with his feet (he just pushes backwards) but he plays with it atleast once a day. He does not have problems climbing on the toy and really gets a kick out of the music feature. He's figured out how to activate the music by pressing the nose on the face, however we have not gotten much use out of the balls and basket feature.All in all, this is a good toy but had we not received this as a gift, it would not have been worth the money.",toys games,baby toddler toys,push pull toys,344

The baby took them fine, but she was extremely gassy and had a tendency to spit up a lot. I was happy that I had these around; I didn't plan on needing a lot of bottles because I was going to nurse. (A baby sometimes has other ideas...) These bottles specifically touted being good for breast milk, so we thought we would give them a try. There was a noted decrease in gas and spit up immediately, so we were thrilled about that.The only issue I had with the drop-in style bottle is the size of the inserts. The smallest size they have was 4oz. This will work fine for us in a few weeks, but when we first took the baby home, she was eating less than two ounces. The frustration with these bottles when the baby is eating so little is having to ""plunge"" the air out of them. When you are only putting an oz of milk into a 4oz bag, most of the milk gets caught up in the squeezed and plunged part of the bag! One last night, around 2am, we had a hungry baby and were trying to prepare the bottle. We were using a small tube-shaped container to plunge the bottle. I accidentally plunged too far into the bottle and couldn't get the plunger out. Needless to say, that bottle was not salvageable. In the light of 2am with a crying, hungry baby and now the need to heat up more milk, These bottles didn't make me too happy. So, we have retired them for now. We will start to use them again when she gets a little older and is closer to drinking 4oz.Overall, I am still happy with these, regardless of the morning fiasco.

People kept telling me not to do that because he would get confused. But with the Avent system, I had no problems. The nipples are designed to control the flow of the milk, so if you are breastfeeding and bottlefeeding, the baby will respond to both. The milk comes out slower than other bottles, so the baby still has to work for it, like it does on the breast. Plus, the base of the nipples is larger, making the baby open their mouth wider to latch on to it...just like in breastfeeding. No confusion!!I found the pump to be awesome. I had had trouble producing milk into the pump, as long as I drank enough fluids during the day. I used to take it in the car with me and my record was pumping 7 oz of milk in 7 mins. That's an ounce a minute! I never had any trouble pumping at least 5 oz at any given time.I've recommended this system to many of my friends and I recommend it to YOU also.I like the fact you can pump right into the liners and then freeze them as soon as you're finished pumping. I never boiled the nipples or heated the bottles on the stove. I alwasys washed them in hot water and would take a bottle out of the fridge and run it under hot water. This was warm enough for him to drink it.ONce my son was over 6 months old, I switched to the larger 9oz bottles that don't have liners and we used those with formula. These nipples have 4 holes in the top for faster flow, as the baby can take more milk then.I completely love this system.",baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,302

Almost bought a Braun last xmas but I'm too cheap.So, I'd say that I learned a few things with this razor:1. Read the manual to figure out what that little switch on the side does.2. Always either wash your face or have a wet rag nearby to avoid having a dry face- that makes shaving terrible even with this razor. Lectric Shave is also great stuff but I wish that they had something that did what Lectric Shave did without alcohol. Don't like dry skin.3. You'll probably have to find the position and direction on your face that works for taking off the hair. My hair runs several directions in some cases.4. Go over the spots you just did and make sure you got it all. Not much is more aggrivating than having stubble on a few spots but clear everywhere else.5. Stick with it!!!! It took me about 3 weeks to start to get used to the razor and it makes a big difference in terms of mess, time, etc. by using the electric as opposed to the blade.6.

It's very maneuverable, and rolls silky smooth. Rolls easily on grass, too, for those trips to the park.The seat is comfortably padded, can face forwards or rearwards, and has an ingenious ""infinite adjustment"" to tilt the seat very precisely at any angle. The 5-point harness, with two height adjustments, holds the child securely. The seat is very easy to add and remove from the stroller.There is adequate storage under the seat, with waterproof plastic on the bottom for those rainy days.The construction is impressive, and the unit is very well made. It even came with a portable air pump for the rear tires.The minor drawbacks are that the sunshade is on the small side (could have used another 6 inches of coverage), and the unit is not light. However, it's not light, because it's made out of metal instead of cheap plastic.None of these drawbacks are a big deal, and I would but it again tomorrow. It's a great stroller.It's age-rated for ""6 months and up"" but we put our 15lb 3-month-old in there with no problems. She loves the smooth ride, and since the shock absorbers soak up bumpy pavement, the baby sleeps uninterrupted on walks.There is also a bassinet sold in England, which could be ordered.We're very happy with this unit.",baby products,strollers,travel systems,250

It is recessed inside a little bit to make the gate completely flat. My husband can't even do it because his fingers are too big. I'm pretty petite, and I hurt my fingers trying to open it.

As the water with bleach sits in your toilet bowl, it does clean the bowl below the water line; but the sides of the bowl ABOVE the water line remain dirty. In my experience, the sides of the toilet bowl turn a light brownish-gray, and periodically I have to scrub them with a brush to make them look cleaner. If you get any excrement on the sides of the toilet bowl above the water line, the excrement will just sit there. It never gets washed away, no matter how many times you flush.

The robot has a lot of fun and entertaining data stored and it does remember some of the stuff you input in to it's tiny memory. The only backdraw and also the only reason I rated this toy 4 stars is that the sensors, as in so many of the cheaper robots, are somewhat useless. If the robot drives, and it does this very slow, and encounters an obstacle, it gets stuck most of the times and you could run the risk of burning out the motor or damaging the gears. I think that this is a minor setback though since this robot wasn't developed for pure autonomy but rather with having the user be within eyesight and able to assist the robot when needed.

5453,B0006N8XZK,Grand Canyon Express Remote-Control Train Set - G Scale,A74NZUVWJ7KWT,22/22,4.0,1134604800,"I initially bought this toy train set to use as a stylish Christmas decoration rather than as an operational train set. Primarily I was looking for table top or mantle piece item that would remind me of the train sets I had recieved at Christmas in the late 1940s and early 1950s without costing an arm and a leg. I wanted a set that I could set up, operate, take down, and pack away until next year with a minimum of fuss. This set more than fills that bill. The quality of the pieces is very high considering the modest sales price. The wife and I were so taken by the fit and finish of the set when we opened the box that we decided to go ahead and set the train up running around the tree. It took only a few minutes to set up a simple circular track, install the 6 ""C"" cell batteries in the engine tender, and a 9 volt transistor battery in the radio transmitter remote control. This set comes without batteries so you should make sure you have fresh batteries on hand as the train just won't run with weak or run down older batteries as we found out. The large scale make this an easy item for the bifocal set to manage and the radio based remote control allows easy single speed forward, reverse, and stop operation. There is also a preprogrammed set of train sounds that are triggered by the remote. The smoke stack also emits small puffs of smoke just the same as when I was a child. Very nostalgic. I suspect that playing the train sounds once or twice for guests will be enough for most adults but children who are old enough to be fascinated by loud sounds will really love that feature. Sure got the cat's attention. I bought the extra track at the same time as the train set but the track that comes with the set is sure to be enough for most uses. The only potential downside to this set is the rate of battery consumption. The C cell batteries have to operate the engine motor, the head lamp, the train sounds, and the smoke generator so there is potentially a lot of current drain from those batteries. There is no battery charger provided nor mentioned in the instructions so consumption could be an issue if the set is operated on a fairly continuous basis. Overall I would highly recommend this set for the purposes outlined.",toys games,electronics for kids,unknown,421

On the recommendation of the store owner, my husband and I bought a bottle of Gator Hammock at a specialty hot sauce shop in Dahlonega, GA. This is some truly flavorful hot sauce. Yes, it is hot, but not the kind of hot that you have to sign a waiver for or that will make you cry. I'd rate this at about a 5 on a 1-10 heat scale. Heat is great, I guess, if you're just trying to prove how macho you are or are the kind of person that thinks that eating should start with a dare. But what we really love about this sauce is the flavor it imparts. It must be in the mystery ""spice blend"" mentioned on the bottle. It's a bit fruity from the peppers but not at all sweet. It has some savory notes and is much more complex than a basic Tabasco or Texas Pete. There is not a pronounced vinegar flavor as is the case with some other hot sauces. I haven't tried this yet, but I'd imagine it would be amazing to add just a splash to tomato soup or to a Bloody Mary.What I have done is 1)mix it half and half with ketchup for a spicy burger topping, 2)added a splash to scrambled eggs (best scrambled eggs ever) and 3)added a little to some pulled pork barbeque along with a splash of vinegar and a tiny squeeze of honey.

He was a decent sleeper from the start (unlike his brother), but would take a long time to actually fall asleep for the night. I began using the sleep balm with him at about six weeks--rubbing a bit on his temples, behind his ears and his chest. Within thee days of using the product, he started going down for the night easily after his nursing session and sleeping in longer stretches. Clearly, I cannot attribute his sleep to the balm, but I am convinced it does help. I think the scent helps signal to him that it is night and time for sleep--it is a way to engage his sense of smell into our well-established night routine. It doesn't hurt that it has a lovely smell that I enjoy. As our initial tin begins to disappear, I am buying more...I am not willing to jinx the good sleep we are experiencing!",health personal care,personal care,lip care products,166

You either play with them or are a collector. So let's get to the points. The articulation is somewhat full, hip and thigs have no real joints but they are made to do various poses, but good luck getting them there. They are stiff as wood. The detail is very good until you get tot he face. That is probably the major drawback, the face. If you pose it right it looks somewhat like Dante, but other than that it might as well be Raiden from MGS2 with white hair or the brother of Olga Gerlukavich from the same game. The bonus weapons of the shotgun, Ebony and Ivory, the guitar, all look like the weapons for ht egame, except the shotgun might be the design from DMC 2. The reason Isay this is because the hilt of Rebellion seems to look more like DMC 2, even though it does have the face awakened,it has the bulky hilt or hand guard as the Rebellion from Devil May Cry 2. In DMC 3, the game the real model for the sword should be based off of, Rebellion has those thin hilts that stick out instead of hte blockier build. Just look at the two swords and You'll see what I mean. Also, Dante is shorter than a can of soda. Still, if you're a hardcore DMC fan and own all the games, all the books, all the shirts (yes I do own them all) and a replica of one of the one of swords (I got Rebellion), then you should buy this one.",toys games,action toy figures,figures,300

Her fur was too rough, and ours seemed to have been sewn a little defectively, with fur too close to one eye, covering it persistently, despite my attempts to manipulate that. Also the fur near top of her head sewn in a very triangular shape, rather than rounded. Her legs splayed a bit far with puppet on (or off) and attempts to hold feet in place. Also her feet/paws stuffed to a hardness that when moved around was more like a deceased cat (I don't even want to say dead cat, but that's what it made me think of). Also, her face and cheeks are similarly hard and stuffed, with a very hard and very small mouth, too tough to manipulate. (This is unlike many of the other Folkmanis puppets.) She has a little tongue that is like a piece of fabric or paper stuck in the mouth, supposed to make it cute or interesting, but it wasn't. (Cannot manipulate the tongue.) I had thought her fat cat body would be cute or cuddly in some manner, but she was entirely (and sadly for us) unappealing to my two little children as well.

He hates cat messes of ANY kind. The first few days we had them I used plastic bags, we all know how those go. Smelly, messy, and if you miss the whole in the bottom of one.....I purchased this at a national pet store chain because I needed to do something fast, and if there were issues I wanted to return it easily and try something else.I have had it for a month now, I am still on the first cartridge that came with it, once a week (or when the wheel gets hard to turn) I open the lid tie off the tube bag, carry it to the trash I am about to take out and seperate the handles. Done. No smell, no litter leaks, and no single plastic bags. I then just pull off enough bag to tie a knot and turn the wheel enough to make sure it's secure.I am using Tidy Cat litter, mainly because it seems to clump on urine the best, and they like to use the same area of the litter box to urinate. With this litter the way it clumps tends to take a lot of litter out at once, (I am ok with this, it allows a nice rate of litter turn over), I turn the wheel enough to seal off the litter clumps, which when it's almost empty is half a turn, and when it's almost full is less than a quarter turn. I don't smell the used litter, and no one else can either.All in all I am very happy with it, and would continue to purchase refills from Amazon.com as they are the cheapest ones available.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,309

If you need a covered litter box then this is a great choice. I have 3 Large size boxes now (for my 2 permanent kitties).If put together properly and used properly then it works great at removing clumps while allowing the clean litter to remain in the box. It lessens the need to ""touch"" the dirty litter via scooping as all you need to do is remove and dump out the 'drawer'. I will say that it can take a little finesse to roll the box over, back to the neutral position, and then a little past neutral with a little shake to even the litter back out. But everyone who has ever seen/tried my Omega Paw litter boxes have become believers.Both of my current cats are also litter throwers so the shape and design of the box keeps the litter well contained (the boxes are nice and deep). If you are wondering whether to buy the regular size or the large size box, I recommend opting for the larger size as it gives your cat more room to move around. My two cats are large and lean, 12 and 14lbs - big guys - and they have plenty of room in the box.One caveat to any litter box - it still needs to be properly maintained. Meaning frequent scrub downs in addition to the clump removal. I find these Omega Paw boxes to be easy to take apart, wash, and put back together.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,279

After all the dust, stench, and ugly box I finally decided to find a good litter box. I was thinking of getting an automatic self cleaner, but didn't know I would have came across this. When I buy something I do extensive research on the product. This product has positive reviews from Petco, Amazon, and Costco.Reasons this product is ingenious:1. Keeps litter in the box(I put a mat to help as well. I noticed a dramatic difference)2. Doesn't require replaceable filters (which other brands can add up in $)3. Doesn't force you to buy their company's litter. It allows you to use generic clumping litter. (also other brands can add up in $)4. Very easy to use and put together (It takes me less then 5 minutes to clean and less then 10 minutes to put together)5. Doesn't require power and nor does it have cords6. enough room for my big cat Toby &lt;37. Affordable/ Economical8. My dog isn't as interested in the new box,like he was in the basic litter box I had prior9. Reduces smell dramatically10. Comes with a lid so you don't have to see cat wasteDown Side:- Sometimes a clump might get stuck, but I kept my scooper and will just shovel it and then turn it over and everything gets filtered.- Not a wide variety of box colors (but the one I have is neutral and matches my house)Side notes:-I have 1 cat-Homes with multiple cats may have problems.-I clean it once a day (It's fun and I'm so thankful I bought it)But even when I had waited a week to clean it, it still worked wellOther Litter Box Notes:- My sister bought a Litter Maid and said she had to return it numerous times for repair (she only has 1 small kitten).when I demonstrated mine she was ecstatic and now is ordering one- My other sister has a Genie litter box for her 1 cat and it works amazing. Its like the cat has his own toilet and you forget about the chore. But the down sides is that it is very expensive to purchase, makes noise when it cleans out, requires you to buy their brands litter (but gets recycled a few times), and requires a place to plug in the pump (laundry area or bathroom)Hope This Helps :)",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,392

He loves to suck I think partly for the comfort of it at times. I have had an amazing milk flow production so far... however, a few days ago, I felt like I was running low, and I found myself drinking a chamomile vanilla tea about 3 times a day. I LOVE herbal teas... so I thought, why not drink tea that will actually help with producing more milk. I have been eyeing this on amazon lately. I read a lot of reviews about taste, etc. So I wanted to try it first. I send my husband to our local organic health food store. MIND you, he paid about $8 for ONE box of 16 bags of tea. I immediately tried some, and I take my tea with honey... and I REALLY liked it. I was thinking to myself, why others do not like the taste?! Another thing worth mentioning, I use my Keurig coffee maker to brew the HOT water, in my 16oz Contigo cup. I dont like the idea of a hot cup of tea around my baby without a lid and am paranoid it would burn someone. I carry my Contigo cup everywhere with me, full of tea. That said, I only use 1 tea bag in my 16onz cup. This is double the size they say to use on the box. However, I dont think it is bad... You should drink significantly MORE water when you're nursing. I actually always have my 30onz cup of ice water. I do drink this tea before bed, typically 1 to 2 16onz cups. I drink the same sized cup in the morning when I wake up, and throughout the day I drink it either over ice, or in the hot cup... As I said, I like the taste, and being that I am not going on 3 days drinking this, I can see the difference. If the difference is because of this tea, or just the fact that my son nurses A LOT and my body is making more milk to compensate for that fact, I dont care. I like the tea and will continue to drink it. THIS price here is the BEST I have found around.

The only negative I can think of is that it traps litter, really well, perhaps too much. I use a litter with a very small pellet size (Swheat Scoop) and the small particles do not come up from this carpet easily. Vacuuming does not work, I can get the larger pellets off by vacuuming or just knocking them back into the box but I get a tan dust residue left over from the pieces. This might be partially because my cat likes to dig the litter out of the box at times, onto this carpet. So it might not be a problem with cats who only have pieces that get caught in the kittys hair or paws. The only solution I have found is periodically taking the carpet outside and rinsing it off with water and then allowing it to dry. I don't do that very often so I figure I will just have to live with the tan dust on this mat.Overall works extremely well at catching the litter and if you use a type that does not have small pellets or dusting issues this mat should be perfect.",pet supplies,cats,litter housebreaking,234

Shaving cream, check. Tweezerman badger brush, check. Single edge razor?, I like my Mach 3 razor. This was the only difference I chose, from the ""proper way of shaving"". This took me a few times to get use to, using Edge & Gillette all my adult life, spray it into hand and apply to face, it would foam and shave. Not that convienient with this cream. For me, get the water nice and hot, rinse brush until brush was moist. You need to ""whip"" the cream why the brush is moist and hot. The very first time, I don't think I did it right, so the shave was ehhh for me. I was thinking going back to old faithful Gillette/edge. But I told myself to try it a few more times to decide. I ask you to try it a few times before thinking abandonment. I am happy to say, I chose to stick with it. With practice, I was able to get the ""whipping"" technique to work and lather up the brush with just the right amount of shaving cream. I apply the shaving cream with the brush (maybe I am doing it wrong) with an up and down movement. The shaving cream isn't thick and foamy; it's a thin even layer on your face. And after the shave, my face is smooth and ""slippery"" the glycerin definitely helps glide the blades on your face. Now I am nearing the end of the jar, so I visited Amazon yet again. The sandalwood scent is not over powering, but I would like to try another scent maybe. Disappointed that the sandalwood is the only that qualifies for free shipping. I was eyeing the avocado one, or maybe just go back to the sandalwood. I don't see myself going back to Gillette/edge.

I completely clean the fountain, taking it apart and washing every bit of it once or twice a week, but that unfortunately hasn't helped. With the fountain always clean, I was expecting the motor to remain healthy but cleaniness has never seemed to help. Each motor has quietly died and soon after purchasing a fountain, I find myself back on Amazon buying a new one. Yes, I know that you can buy only the motor but, most of the time, the price difference between the new motor and the new fountain is negligible so I always decide to start over.So if you want to give your kitties fresh, flowing water, buy the fountain.

After easily beating my nephew repeatedly, I purchased a set for him to even the odds a bit.This add-on gives you a HUGE advantage. It allows you to do three things.1) Aim quickly and accurately with use of the sight, and keep the target locked on until they run away and hide.2) Get more tactile feedback for when you are getting hit so you know when to go hide yourself.3) You can easily play with the sound off, and act like a sniper.Basically the add on kit allows you to turn off the sounds as they add little value. This allows you to move and fire quietly, which is perfect for sniping. Many times I would be getting hit and start looking in completely the wrong direction, before I realized I should run and hide. If you don't have the scope and your opponent, and you start getting hit, you might as well just run, because even if you find him you will only get off 2 or 3 tags before you lose 10 of yours.Another advantage I didn't expect comes from the scope. Basically you don't miss ever. You only realize what a big advantage this is when you don't have the scope. My nephew went from losing 10 tags to one, to winning 3 tags for every one that I landed. Basically, I would miss 2 out of 3 shots aiming with the IRDX ironsights, while he could pull the trigger with confidence that he would hit me every time. This would allow him to sit still in my ambush, turn find me and kill me before I could get more than half of his tags.When I switched guns with my nephew I was able to drain him of fifty tags in about 30 seconds from well over 250 feet away. He was shocked when I shouted out my location after he was tagged out.My only complaints is that you get no feedback for when you need to reload, no feedback for lock-on of foe or friend, and the firing feedback makes it difficult to tell if you are getting hit at times.All this said, if you don't have this accessory pack and your opponenet does, expect to lose a lot.",toys games,sports outdoor play,sports,391

It is fast and will get the job done, and for men that have to shave more than once during the day, it's great to just carry along in the car to do quick touch-ups, just charge it during the weekend then stick it in your car or briefcase for that quick second shave during the workday. The floating head is very comfortable, leaving no razor burn, and it definitely does the job faster than using manual razors. The ease in which the unit cleans is also nice. Simply rinse the head under water and let it dry in the charging stand. The Arcitec has a super long battery life along with a quick charge feature. When fully charged it doesn't have to go back on the charger for almost three weeks. This makes the unit very portable if you so desire. On the downside, it doesn't seem to shave as close though as a 2 or 3-head razor, and the trimmer is poorly designed and of little use. It's pretty pricey too, and debatable that the performance really warrants the price.Norelco offers a no questions asked 40 day return policy on the razor, a good indication that they really stand behind this product.",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,219

When we called Cosco to try to get a refund, all they offered was a replacement piece. The cust. serv. lady said that the piece isn't really necessary. I ask, why is the piece on the carseat if it is not necessary? After arguing with her, she finally admitted that this piece being broken does lessen the effectiveness of the carseat and increases my baby's chances of injury. Cosco still would not offer to refund the money I paid (I have the original receipt)for the carseat and only offered to send the replacement part via 2 day mail. You'd think they would atleast offer to overnight it, considering I explained to her that it is the only carseat I have and my baby has had to ride in it with this part broken.

Yes, they group the ""whole grains and seeds"" as first ingredient (actually, the first set of ingredients). Within this ""ingredient"", they include whole wheat flour, black and white sesame seeds, millet, mustard seeds, poppy seeds, triticale meal, rye meal, malted wheat flakes, oats, brown rice meal, and barley flakes). Then the next ""ingredient"" is enriched flour.The problem is that there is no way to determine whether the first ""ingredient"" is 80% of the total recipe or 40% -- and no way of knowing, within that amount, how much is in each sub-ingredient. I suspect that they did this unusual grouping of ingredients to hide their recipe -- but, as noted by the other reviewer's reaction, it may very well be counter-productive. If they had split out the set of ingredients into their separate parts, one would have a much better idea as to how it is made.I have been counseled that I am pre-diabetic. For me, therefore, it is very important to keep up the dietary fiber in the carbohydrates that I eat (slows digestion, keeps insulin levels steadier). Looking through my local supermarket, the GrainsFirst crackers was the only cracker & cheese type of cracker that met the criteria of 2g dietary fiber or more per serving (they actually list exactly 2g). It's tasty and it fits my dietary needs (sure, I'd rather have 3 or 4g -- work with what one can get).There are other crackers that meet the dietary criteria -- like Triscuits and a few others -- but they aren't really the same category of cracker in my opinion.Worth some extra money -- but you may be able to beat the price from Amazon if you can find them locally.",grocery gourmet food,snack food,crackers,309

My first himmy had dietary problems and I had to feed him a special diet. When he passed away at the young age of 12 I bought another himmy kitten and then another one. I noticed that the first kitten had constant diarrhea type stools(half solid,ending with diarrhea)and I noticed that he was very sleepy and lethargic during the day. The food I was feeding him at the time was Merrick. Later on I would find out that cats are not suppose to be eating that many grains,fruits and vegetables so I switched to EVO which has more protein and higher fat content and is more closer to their natural dietary requirements. It has made a difference though not as much of a difference as I would have liked. Maybe he will get better through time on this diet. What I can tell you is that in the past month that I have switched over he has no more diarrhea and has a little more energy. He also drinks a lot more water and I'm hoping that this is not a problem. If it keeps up I will come back and comment. Its so important to buy your cats the food that is best for them and not something that you like. They weren't meant to eat what people eat. A breeder once told me that she sold a cat to a woman who only gave it what she ate and didn't buy cat food. The kitten died about 4 monthslater.When she came back to buy another and the breeder found out what she did she didn't sell her anymore kittens. So stupid but I had to use as an example to make the point. A cat will die w/o it's proper nutrition even if you are ""feeding"" it. So if you don't feed a cat what it was meant to eat then you are taking years off of its life. Don't buy inferior food if you love your cat.This is an update",pet supplies,cats,food,343

It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products.

It is taking her a little while to get her head around it, which is exactly the type of educational toys I like - it prompts development and keeps interest for longer than a couple of days. The toy is well made, has a nice rubbery base that imitates embroidery. Using a pin and a thread is a great exercise for fine motor skills development. The set has several patters a child could try to replicate, and here you have color-matching and pattern-matching skills working, plus early counting as it takes to count how many holes left, right, up, or down you have to go to make the pattern. Moreover, it often takes two-step counting, such as three hole left and one down, so get it right. Later on a child can create their own pictures (which may require to buy additional colorful shoe strings, though). The toy is light and self-containing, with a little handle, so a child can carry it with him/her. The toy is clearly too hard for my daughter to do by herself at this point, but she can do it with my assistance (again, that's the best kind of an educational toy, as children get to learn new skills from adults).

The description on Amazon says its for dogs and cats. The quantity for the price was good. My cat still has some dandruff, though from her ordeal before I adopted her at 1 year, sometimes hunting for food. She was too very fluffy and would not let me brush her except when in the ""tub"". At first they bathed her at the vet. They carried shampoo for cats--Natural Care Oatmeal flea relief Cat Shampoo. It smelled great--refreshingly woodsy. This will be good because she likes to get her face washed and this is at least somewhat tearless, according to the description. Grandpa's pine tar soap makes good dandruff shampoo for humans. But this says it is hypo-allergenic--No herbs that are poisonous for cats. She likes her bath in a medium-small dish pan in the kitchen sink with something to strain the cat hairs in the drain area. The sink recently was plugged and I kind of suspect cat (and human) hair. Warmth and a wire brush help the shedding process while soaking. The shampoo seems good, and smells (mild smell) like flowers, or maybe air freshener, which is a plus. Seeing she soaks in it, it has to be very nontoxic. Gave 3 stars and later edited to 4 stars because it seems mild. I tested it on my own eyes with a little of the suds. It seemed not to be very tearless on me, though, but I can't compare. It still would be nice to have a safe, mild shampoo that states its FOR CATS (even if for dogs also) on the label, I guess. Pinetar soap is good for dandruff in humans. Maybe some pine extract (not like pine-sol, like maple syrup or sap) could be good for cats with dandruff, too.",pet supplies,dogs,grooming,312

She is a hairstylist, I am an electrician, but regardless of occupation, I can't imagine a time, (on appropriately sized wounds), that this product isn't perfect.Does it sting? Yessir it does. I use it on wounds that are probably supposed to be to big for it, so believe me, I have dealt with some stinging.

Meet someone who is not the most attractive person in the world and then fall in love with them, it might not make them a beauty queen, but they look better all the time to you.Simply put, this product, when used correctly, works. my recommendations are as follows.1. Put this product on as you are watching your evening TV. This will accomplish three things, one, it allows you to apply and let dry without thinking about it, two, while you're sleeping, it seems to setup extra strong. It will not just rub off throughout the night, and with no hand washing or anything going on, it really has a chance to take. Finally, you at least have that first overnight period of healing under your belt, and you will often times be amazed at what that small amount of time can accomplish.2. Apply New Skin generously. As it settles it will thin out, but how thin do you need it to be?

We received the bouncer as a gift so aren't so concerned about getting value for our money. But we agree with/have noticed the following:1. It does get too loud. We've put masking tape over most of the speaker holes. Function before fashion.2. Our frog clicks too. I sort of bent it outward (away from the frame) and the problem has been resolved now for several weeks.3. The vibration of the battery box is BAD. I will try the idea of taping it up somehow to the underside of the seat. We have arranged a temporary fix by putting a firm sofa cushion under the front edge of the chair to support the box and muffle the vibration.4. The toys are WAY too low. Our daughter is just now three months old and she's been hitting her legs on them for weeks. We will be cutting the parrot off this weekend as it's the worst offender.5. You should supervise your child in this chair. It has a tendency to be somewhat overstimulating with the vibration and the music and the waterfall and the constant movement. Wish there was a way to have the waterfall without the music -- again, masking tape would solve that problem.All that being said, the chair is fun, bright, and a good place to park the child after a feeding or while tending to chores.

I have three cats who all have the feline herpes virus, and I used to use another product and would just put it on their feet and they lick it off, but the manufacturer changed that formulation so I tried Viralys gel. Like I said, if they made it thicker, I could easily slather it on my cats and dispense it to them that way. It's good that this gel is transparent--that way it doesn't stain the carpet if they shake it off. I put a quarter-sized dab on their hindquarters and then they lick it. I recently purchased the L-Lysine powder, for humans (it's a quarter the price of the pet variety) and sprinkle it on their wet food. The downside of using this is that now the cats don't like dry food, and I hate wet food--it's smelly, messy and gives them bad breath. Well, they have to have Lysine somehow so sacrifices have to be made.

First, it does not prevent or do too much to keep me from rolling onto my back. I have found that adding a pillow under one side of the back n' belly and wedging the pillow under my back as I lie on my side does help to prevent rolling. Another issue to note with this product is its size - while it obviously is not small based on the picture online, its overall bulk is not truly appreciated until it is taking up half of a queen bed. The final thing to note before purchasing this item is that it is not too easy to get out of in the middle of the night (for example, to go to the bathroom). Specifically, I have had to be very careful not to fall out of our bed... Overall, I imagine there are few items that will truly be effective in keeping me from rolling onto my back, but the item is very large and having used a snoogle in the past, I wonder if snoogles, which are smaller and shaped like candy canes rather than horse-shoes, are a bit more manageable.",baby products,pregnancy maternity,maternity pillows,225

Personally, I did not mind that I have to shove the pillow down a bit - I think it actually makes it easier to feed when the pillow is like that.Final note - I was a bit nervous about the neutral color and the wood looking a bit odd on Amazon, but I think the color of the wood and the cushion color look better in person.

It's named mahogany violet (labeled 4MV). It isn't outre (punky) at all, really it isn't. It looks like a nice dark brown but especially when in sunlight, there is a violet sheen. I considered using a drabber because I prefer ash tones, but I didn't want to get too fancy.Another good feature of this product is when mixed with developer it becomes the consistency of custard in 5-7 minutes so it doesn't drip, but it also doesn't squeeze out of those pointy applicators -- you must use a bowl and brush.For the first year or so that I've been using this hair color, I was pretty happy. Then I guess I got more grey hair so that now, it doesn't cover it anymore. I've tried increasing the proportion of dye to CG (as in 'cover grey') developer from 1:2 to 1:1, or even stronger; leaving it in way longer than the recommended 45 minutes... but as soon as I finish the coloring process, I can already see hairs and roots that are very, very light. The color fades within 2-3 shampoos even though it's supposed to be 'permanent' hair color.Maybe my coarse Asian hair is more resistant or some other special factor like that, but I would not recommend Satin to cover grey.If I have to color my hair every 2-3 weeks, I may as well go back to Wella's Color Charm semi-permanent color of Deep Violet (3V) andWella Color Charm Creme Developer - 30 Volume 16 oz. It is an actual black (not brown) but a level 3 so not as severe as 1.

The whole thing seemed rather poorly designed and constructed.On the plus side, it is nearly fully assembled already in the box.The height is not adjustable and there is no tray to speak of - just cup holders, which you better hope you have cups that will fit right in there to hold your paints, chalk, or whatever. Also, it comes with wimpy magnets apparently to hold the art paper in place. Yeah right. The flip concept is definitely a cool idea. Hope someone figures out how to execute it well, because this isn't it. The Discovery Channel product is awesome especially for the price.",toys games,arts crafts,easels,220

It seems to good to be true, and I think it is. The diapers are indeed thinner and more flexible than the older Pampers and other brands. They are less bulky on baby, which is nice aesthetically and probably comfort-wise for baby. But I have not been impressed by these diapers' absorbency or leak prevention. Since I started using these, my baby has woken up from naps with pee leaks on her tummy (she sleeps on her stomach). This did not used to happen. With these diapers, I have to be sure to change them very frequently or she will have a leak. Not that I advocate leaving wet diapers on babies for long periods of time, but these diapers just don't seem to cut you any slack on forgetting to watch the clock. I wouldn't dare use these overnight, I'm sure my daughter would be swimming in pee in the morning if I did. I use the Huggies Overnights for bedtime and they keep it all in for 11 hours at a time.I've also found that this thinner design just feels flimsy to me. I've felt like the diapers feel wet on the outside much much sooner than they should. And I guess this is a good thing- but it is very hard to tell when there is liquid in them because they don't seem to ""change"" much when they get wet, like some other diapers. I think I actually prefer a little diaper swelling just so I know by touch that is is time to change.I guess I don't see that these diapers offer any advantage over other brands, unless you really hate how bulky other diapers are. I, for one, just want my diapers to hold in baby waste effectively, and I feel that these don't do as good of a job of that as others.

An example problem solving question is-- your dinosaur gallops forward 40 miles and back 20 miles each day -- how far does he get in two days?As another reviewer mentioned, the action cards had a lot of errors. For example, yellow dinosaurs are 1's, yet one of the action cards tells you to move the yellow dinosaur 3 thousands. The blue dinosaur is actually thousands so you have to modify the cards so that the kids don't get confused. I agree that the price of the game is too much to permit such mistakes.

I don't see how but then again I don't see a reason to have to scrape your teeth clean more often than once a month or every couple of weeks. Stuff does not build up that fast on your teeth anyway. Handles are comfortable and these tools seem of good quality. I expect they will last a long time.,health personal care,health care,pain relievers,121

Glycerine is a colorless, odorless fat that makes an ideal base for food, skin products, and other items. It's even found in wine and beer. It helps give a bit of ""body"" to a product without affecting how it tastes or smells.For skin care, glycerine in essence coats the skin with a layer of thickish oil, so that moisture is kept in. It also means your hands remain a bit sticky for a short while afterwards. Glycerine is often used for hands and feet, where a soft sock or mitten is put on afterwards to keep the glycerine from rubbing off. If I can wait the five or ten minutes, I simply put it on and wait for it to absorb in. I *love* the way my hands feel after I use this,The Camille Beckman white tub of glycerine has a nice, light pink color and soft rose aroma. It has a cool rosebud on top too :). The tub is easy to scoop the glycerine out of, and the cream goes on smoothly. It does remain sticky immediately after you put it on, but as I mentioned, this is normal. I use this on my feet when I'm relaxing, putting clean socks on over the glycerine and letting it soak in. I love putting it on my hands. In fact there are times that I'll be typing away, and my fingers will feel a little rough, and I'll go get some cream to put on. It's like my fingers crave the lotion :) It's definitely much better for my hands than pretty much any other lotions I've tried.The only downside here is that it's a bit expensive, and it's not found in most grocery stores.

Now that our son is bigger (10 mos.) the strap does slip as he jumps because he's more vigorous in his actions. I adjust it before I put him in and when it's slipped to the point where he's too low I figure it's time to take him out.",baby products,gear,swings,126

The following is a detailed account of my experience:I set up the pool on a ground tarp in an area of my backyard that was reasonably flat, although probably not perfectly level. It seemed to work out fine, but the next day I noticed that the pool was very lopsided. It was leaning heavily to one side and slopping water out all over the yard. It also appeared to have lost some of its air. I thought the problem could probably be solved if the ground surface was leveled out to some degree. I drained the pool and make a level surface with some plywood and I added extra support beneath it on the side that the pool had been leaning towards. I laid the ground tarp over this and set the pool up again. I had to partially reinflate it to compensate for the lost air, but there didn't appear to be any leaks. I refilled it and the problem appeared to be fixed...we used it the next day.

I have two dogs, one a bischon frise who'll sleep near about anywhere and a peek-a-poo who enjoys tearing up and dirtying his beds. Both of them took to this bed very well and just, at least I assume, adore this bed.The main reason I got this was that since its nothing but a canvas and frame, I don't have to worry about the little dog tearing it apart and eating any cotton or stuffing. Plus, by taking a baby blanket or a small blanket I can lie it over the canvas top and tie the blanket ends through the open corners, which deters the little dog from chewing up the canvas while also allowing easy clean-up and extra comfort for when the dogs sleep on it. The medium sized version of the pet bed is capable of holding both dogs at the same time with ample space for them to move around.Assembling the pet bed is really a two-person job, but once it's together you never really have to fret with it ever again. I would recommend this if you're sick and tired of washing pet beds till they become a formless pile of cloth and stuffing or if your little dog has a slight chewing problem.

22925,B000BH8TUA,Microlife PF 100 Peak Flow Meter for Spirometry with FEV1,AU9VN9Q26OPVJ,8/9,2.0,1271894400,"Ordered one of these 4/10/10 and just (accidentally) destroyed it this morning.My complaints about this unit:1. You MUST push in a little recessed set button 4x after replacing the batteries. This is for date setting, used only for date-stamping the data storage, which you may or may not care about.2. The unit is awkward to use. This is because it is rounded and slippery, so that you have to wrap your hand around to use it without risk of dropping while violently exhaling (the gist of the test). The power button is centered on top and is large and flush with the surface, so if you tighten your grasp during exhaling, you will power the unit off. I consider this a bad mechanical design.3. FEV1 for a test stays displayed for about a second after the double beep indicating test end, and then you can never see it again. Only PEF (which I don't really care about) stays displayed. Apparently nobody else cares about FEV1 (but then why measure it?)4.If I wheeze during exhale (I'm asthmatic!), it usually aborts the measurement in less than a second. This happens to me every 5th or 6th test. Then the PEF is reasonable but the FEV1 is meaningless. It sometimes will repeat the error until I let the unit sit unused for a couple minutes.5. The unit is rounded on all external surfaces except the snout (no edges or corners) and is made of slippery plastic, w/ no rubber grips. It is designed to slide if placed on a hard tilted surface. This morning I picked up my training log (spiral-bound w/plastic cover)with the unit sitting on top of it. As I began walking it slid off the notebook and hit the floor, expelling the batteries. After replacing the batteries and finding a toothpick to ""set"" the date/time, the unit beeped ready but refused to measure - it is now dead. While I don't expect a delicate mechanical meter to survive such a crash, I DO expect instruments intended for home (rather than clinical) use to be designed in such a way as to avoid rather than facilitate such mishaps.It's too bad this unit does not have a better mechanical design. It appears to have been designed for an ""ergonomic"" look, but is in fact just the opposite.",health personal care,health care,allergy,385

This year we played Ticket to Ride - American version for the first time. I am not really sure how many other games we actually played this year because this game was always out on the table. I am fairly new to ""non-hasbro"" games and because of this game I will be trying more.The object of the game is to complete the destination cards you are given at the beginning of the game. Each route between cities consists of a different number of train cars that may have a specific color or may be gray. During your turn you can claim a route, draw the train cards, or draw more destination cards. The train cards are what allows you to claim a track. If there are 4 red cars between two cities you need to have 4 red train cards to claim it. Once a route is claimed no one else may use it.I bought Ticket to Ride - Europe because it added a few new game play features. These features make route completion a little harder but train stations are added to even out the difficulty. The hardest thing that we have found in the game is getting used to the city names that were used. The game takes place at the turn of the century so some of the cities that have been renamed since 1900 are still using their old names.Both of these Ticket to Ride games are a blast. The American version is ""easier"" than the European version but don't let that sway you.

It is sturdy and simple to operate. It has enough light-gathering power (more important than magnification) to reveal dim star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies and good enough optics to show you the surface of planets like Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars.Dobsonians like this one give by far the most view for the dollar, and the price on this one is great. Affordable as this scope is, there is no reason to give so much as a glance at the numerous trashy 60mm refractors with exaggerated magnification claims that litter the market.Some advice on selection. Dobsonians come in a range of sizes. A 114mm (4 "") is a bit on the small side but still a fine instrument, especially if your ability to carry large objects is limited. A 150-200mm (6-8"") scope like this one is right in the middle of the recommended range. A 250mm (10"") is on the big side, and you should buy one only if you are able-bodied.A very useful bonus is a full-sized 9x50mm finder scope. If competing models offer only a 6x30mm finder, you should factor in the cost of upgrading to the far better 50mm size.You will need eyepieces. Plossl-type eyepieces are good yet affordable",toys games,learning education,science,226

And, adults have fun watching the children have so much fun & once in awhile jump in to see if they can stomp a rocket too - LOL.We've used it about 5 times over the last 2 weeks & it has held up well. There was a 13 year old, a 10 year old & a 2 year old. The older one's stomped on the rocket while the youngest loved watching the rockets launch into the sky. They then would run & find the rockets & bring them back to the older children to do it again. It was fun for all of them & nice that it was something they could do together.The age range is for older kids, but little one's can join in too w/ help & supervision. However, I do want to point out that supervision for the younger one's is very important. The foam of the rockets is basically styrofoam & if bitten off could be very unsafe. Don't let little one's around this by themselves. Safety is top priority.Overall rating is lots of fun for children (and adults - smile) of all ages, but if smaller children are around adult supervision is needed so they don't get the rocket in their mouths.This comes w/ 4 rockets, but if you have a lot of trees I suggest ordering some extras. What goes up doesn't always come down if you have a lot of trees for them to get stuck in.OH! The fact that they glow is super cool!

I had heard great things about this sunscreen, and I originally ordered the SPF 45 on Amazon, but it never arrived. So, I ended up buying bottles of it at my local grocery store.My initial conclusion? The sunblock was fantastic!It wasn't too oily, as far as high SPF sunscreens go, and it absorbed into my skin within minutes, leaving a soft (almost powdery) finish. It didn't flake off or look ghastly white at SPF 45 either, though the SPF 55 did both. It did look a bit shiny, which I found strange since it felt powdery, but, honestly, most people couldn't tell I was wearing sunscreen, even though I generally caked it on.I did notice (having purchased the SPF 55 and the SPF 45) that the higher the SPF the thicker and oiler the sunscreen got. The SPF 55 felt MUCH heavier than the SPF 45.Unfortunately, the SPF 45 started to make my skin sting when I put it on, and the SPF 55 absolutely made my skin burn. At first, I thought it was because my skin was getting sensitive from my retinol night cream, but I tried using the sunscreen after I'd discontinued using the cream, and it still left my skin stinging and irritated.

I chose this model because of the pneumatic tires and the wooden side boards. Both features have turned out to be worth every penny. The big pnematic tires make the wagon smooth and easy to pull on a varity of surfaces. The side boards allow my son to pile it up high with branches and leaves from when he ""helps"" with the yardwork, or when he wants to fill it up with every outdoor toy that we own. :) He loves to ride in the wagon too. We walk to the Farmer's Market almost every weekend and the wagon carries him plus all of our fresh fruits and vegetables (plus kettle korn if he's good). On one occasion, we managed to fit my son and 2 of his cousins in the wagon (ages 2, 5, & 9). And we made it just fine too ... this is one sturdy wagon.Best Features:-Old Fashioned Good Looks-Very sturdy construction-Pneumatic tires are smooth and quiet across a variety of surfaces-Wooden side boards increase capacityDrawbacks:-Metal construction can get hot in the sun-Easy to scrape the paint off the metal handle if it falls on concreteSummary:The pneumatic tires and wooden side boards make this wagon a great child's toy that should last outlast his/her interest and still be good for the next generation.",toys games,tricycles,scooters wagons,247

I think that anyone searching for a pinpoint accurate monitor would assume that a tiny wrist monitor would not provide the accuracy of the big machine you can find at the local drug store or the cuff that the nurse uses to torture your left arm while she/he counts your heart beats, but for those who think this unit can provide the same info that the big ones use I have been told by a Doctor this unit is for noticing drastic changes or numbers that borderline certain levels.The unit itself is very simple to use and the user can easily find instructions on how to use it given there is a copy sewn into the wrist cuff. Simply wrap the monitor around your wrist, monitor face towards you, and secure tightly but comfortably with the Velcro on the cuff material. Hold the monitor at heart height and press the start button until the monitor face lights up. The monitor will begin its automatic cycle and tighten down for about thirty to sixty seconds. After the monitor finishes its cycle the screen will flash between your BP readings and your heartbeat count. For me these reading helped in my treatment and also provide information for me when I feel a little weird and wonder if my heart is freaking out(like I said I'm not a Doctor).

I never ate plantain chips as a kid, but I did enjoy the plantain dumplings in soup; they were delicious and low in fat. Puerto Ricans also combine the ground plantain with other tropical tubers and stewed meats to make a huge dumpling that they boil in parchment paper in order to keep it intact while it cooks in a light brine; it's delicious and filling. At the West Indian markets in NYC, they sell plantain, banana, casava, and peanut flour. So, if you like to cook and experiment, you may want to make dumplings from such flours; I'm not a cook.The Inka chips are thicker than the plantain chips that I ate years ago, making them a suitable cracker substitute. I cover them with peanut butter or fruit preserves and enjoy them as a snack. I also crush them and add them to my bowl of soup in order to give the soup a nice crunch; these chips hold up well in liquid, better than Saltine crackers, with less salt.",grocery gourmet food,snack food,unknown,350

This calculates that on average a child can stay in this seat in a five point harness until the approximate age of a five year old.....reassuring.As most seats on the market have five point harnesses that have a weight limit of 40lbs. The Marathon would allow us more long term growth instead of transitioning into a booster early on and bipassing the shoulder/lap belt combination.We shopped online and found that babies r us had a large selection. However the more we researched we found the prices to be considerably lower and made our purchase from [...] They had a great selection as well but the same seat was offered at [...] shipping included.Our seat arrived just a short four days later.

34617,B000PEAL8C,Chi Vitalizer Chi Machine,A3GZK8AQECD6C3,4/5,4.0,1325116800,"This machine was given to us as a gift for Christmas, and I had seen it on TV once but honestly didn't think much of it. There are many claims of what this machine can do for you, but none that I could actually find officially documented in detail anywhere online besides on sites that sell various Chi machines. I consider myself quite open to alternative medicine and healing, so I figured I'd give it a try. My husband has back problems from work so supposedly this would assist (among many things) with back issues. He's been trying it for a few days now, once a day for about 15 minutes and so far he's felt that it's helped his back pain a bit and helps him to relax so he plans on continuing to use it. As far as I go, I've been using it 2 times a day for about 10-15 minutes per session. I don't have any back pain or any body pain, but I do have anxiety and sleep issues. I've been looking into meditation for my anxiety but I always find it extremely hard to calm my brain down and just breathe. With this machine though, I've found it extremely easy to calm down and clear my brain. The motion of the machine and the noise just seems to help me tune out and completely relax..that's definitely a huge benefit to me. I have also been sleeping better lately which is another big plus. So while I'm not sure if it will help me align my chi, lose weight, boost my immune system and cure any ailments I may have, I know that it definitely helps me reduce stress so far and that is huge. I have found that it's best to use the machine in a quiet room without distraction. This machine has variable speed settings and while I hear it's beneficial to use it at a speed where your whole body is actually moving, you should use it at whatever speed you feel is comfortable to you. The manual advises to start off no longer than 5 minutes for the first week (though for the first day or 2 we tried this and found that going up to 10-15 min was just fine for us), and after any session you should lay still for at least 2-5 minutes to maximize the benefits of the machine. Drink a glass of water when you get up to flush toxins out and that's about it.

17718,B000F9Y188,Quantum Research Canker Cover Oral Canker Sore Patch,A3CO01V7Y2WHXA,19/19,4.0,1236988800,"I was very skeptical of this product initially, but after accidentally biting my lower lip about 4 days ago while chewing gum, I developed a huge canker sore that was so painful I could barely speak. It was about half an inch long and a quarter inch wide. And it wasn't going away. I found myself using benzocaine solutions almost hourly, which as you might already know, amplifies the pain like 10x while you're putting it on at first. I was desperate. I heard about this product online, and actually drove to Walgreens and Target before finding it at CVS.Well, when I opened the package and saw these tiny, hard, white discs, I was even more skeptical. I thought, what good could these possibly do? Luckily the sore was in a spot where I could keep the area dry. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. Applying the disc on a dry spot is critical to having it stick and do its job. Unfortunately, the shape and size of the canker sore made it impossible to cover it entirely with the disc. There was a small part that remained exposed. As it turns out, this had some dramatic consequences.The disc turned into a gel as described, and did a fairly good job of relieving the pain. I could still feel some pain due to the bulk of the patch rubbing against my teeth, but much less than before. And since there was a small spot that didn't get covered, that still hurt a lot. I nearly thought of taking a second disc, cutting it in half, and applying it to get full coverage.Well, about 6 hours later, my tongue eventually rubbed the patch loose. It started to break off so I decided I'd pull the rest off and see what happened. This is where it gets interesting. The area that was covered had noticeably healed. The sore was still there--but because one area had been left uncovered, I could plainly see that even just after 6 hours something amazing happened. I could see that the covered part had already begun the healing process and was much less painful than the untreated area.I'm not kidding you. This product works. It's not perfect--for one thing, it's bulky and tastes a bit funny and looks really bizarre. It could also come in a larger size, or at least be a bit less expensive so you don't feel so bad about using more than one disc. But if you put it on at night before bedtime, let it do its work, it is way better than any numbing gels like Kanka or Zilactin or Anbesol. I've tried them all and I'm not going back. The trick is to get it to stick well (try tilting your head back and use a cotton swab; also, make sure you've pulled out the disc beforehand--the foil packaging is hard to open), and to leave it undisturbed as much as possible. It doesn't contain any anaesthetics--it works simply by covering the area, preventing irritation and exposure to the bacteria and enzymes in your saliva, and allowing your body to heal. For $10 I think it's worth cutting down on the excruciating pain of a canker sore.",health personal care,health care,pain relievers,535

37046,B000K7AH4C,Natural Eyes,A9ARVDAUZEHDM,9/19,3.0,1332892800,"Pinhole Glasses reduce some of the light rays entering the eyes. This reduces some of the blur produced by unfocused light rays in eyes that needs vision improvement. Pinholes act as the eyes pupil does in sunlight; in sunlight the pupil becomes smaller; this reduces light rays in the eye. This is why day vision is clearer than night vision when the eyes need vision improvement. Pinholes do this all the time, in all light and in an unnatural way. This is unhealthy, confuses the brain, eye muscles, iris/pupil muscles, impairs their function... (The iris/pupil muscle is interconnected with the ciliary, lens muscle. Tear gland and other muscles are in the same area and can affect each other when tense, not functioning correct.) Squinting, an Incorrect Vision Habit that causes eye, eye muscle tension and unclear vision is a form of a unnatural pinhole effect.People with cataracts, other eye, vision impairments may see better through pinholes, but this is temporary and prevents Natural Vision Improvement, a return to natural clear vision, healthy eyes.Pinhole glasses are illegal, not safe for driving, work, play. Pinhole glasses block out a large part of the peripheral field of vision. Objects, moving objects are sensed by the peripheral field. Peripheral vision is necessary for safety when driving, bike riding, crossing streets and most activities.Pinhole Glasses are used only in emergencies, for a few seconds to read fine print on a medicine bottle, a distant sign... to prevent squinting and use of eyeglasses. It's better to use the pinhole glasses for a couple seconds than to put on eyeglasses and tense up the eye muscles, eyes, visual system and reverse your vision improvement process. If eyeglasses are needed; only reduced weaker lenses are used and as little as possible. Pinhole glasses are better than eyeglasses because they cause less strain in the visual system than eyeglass lenses, less eye muscle tension so, this can help the vision improve. Pinholes should not be a replacement for natural vision. The more eyeglasses, pinholes are avoided, the faster and easier the vision improves. When the vision improves with use of The Bates Method, then pinhole glasses, eyeglasses are permanently discontinued.Pinhole glasses are unnatural, act like dark, tinted lenses, sunglasses; they block healthy full spectrum sunlight and lower the clarity of vision, health and function of the eyes. The pinholes act as sunglasses and widen the pupil unnaturally in the light. This is harmful to the visual system, function of the brain with the eyes, pupil, iris, lens, retina. Dark glasses cause watering eyes, sensitivity to light, impairs light tolerance. Pinhole glasses with very tiny pinholes, appearing as plain sunglasses are most harmful, block out more healthy sunlight and impair normal eye function.Pinhole glasses do not help the eyes function correct, do not improve function of the eye muscles and brain with the eyes, eye muscles, retina. Pinholes block normal eye, brain, visual system function; prevent the eyes from functioning, focusing, moving perfectly, natural; prevents normal, complete eye movement `shifting', central-fixation, all Correct Vision Habits, accommodation, convergence, un-accommodation, divergence, binocular vision, fusion, depth, distance perception, 3-D vision, peripheral vision.The fovea centralis, macula, the eyes, retina's `central field' must avoid the black areas of the glasses and move to, look through only the pinholes. This makes it difficult for the central light ray to focus perfectly on the center of the fovea centralis. This blocks full, free eye movement, normal central-fixation, perfect central vision. Pinholes prevent the eye muscles (ciliary, iris/pupil/lens, recti, oblique...) from functioning normally. Objects seen through pinholes appear smaller, incorrect size. This impairs memory, imagination, depth, distance... perception, function of the brain with the eyes. This causes strain, impairs the vision. All eyeglasses including pinholes disrupt normal blinking, can cause headaches.Avoid exercises that might come with the pinholes. I am not familiar with them and sellers are usually not natural vision teachers so they might teach things that are unnatural. Pinhole glasses with very small holes, appearing like sunglasses act as sunglasses and block more natural light, can cause other vision problems.Pinhole glasses with very small holes, appearing like sunglasses act as sunglasses and block more natural light, can cause other vision problems.

When it was time to buy a new set of Series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads for my old Norelco 6885XL razor, I decided to get the new 9170XLCC razor. Big Mistake! The new 3-ring Smart Touch heads are not as good as the old reliable Lift-and-Cut heads.Why you say? To make the head look like it has more surface area and thus should cut faster, the Norelo engineers reduced the cutting area of the fastest, outer, ring, to squeeze in the two inner, but slower surface speed, rings. In fact the outer ring cutting blades are only 1.00 mm wide as opposted the the 1.75 mm width cutter width in the series 7 Lift-and-Cut heads. The added inner rings actually cause pulling of the beard hairs if you try to shave at the same speed you did with the older models.By the Way, the so-called cleaning system is a big bother and not worth the extra cost. You can rinse the 9170XL under the faucet just like the older XL models.

This is a budget piece. If you want total wood than spend the $$... I think that it is a great piece for the price. Again I would not recommend having it shipped. They have this entire set in Burlington Coat factory if you want to see it. The deminsions are also on Targets website...My only suggestion is that you stand back and look at the piece and visualize it. It's easy to get a few pieces turned backwards. Take time to tag your pieces with letters. Storkcraft needs to place letters on the pieces. It would make assembly much easier...I like the piece and I was thinking about using it as a closet too. It does not look like a $200 piece. I'm happyI read reviews on products people write who actually have the products. They help me make responsible consumer decisions. Why give a review if you don't have the product... that is not a review it's an opinion!!!,baby products,nursery,furniture,208

If you have like major pimples or something you need to cover you're going to need a concealer or a more coverage foundation. i find this foundation is best for evening out skin tone and hiding some discoloration.The first time i ever used this foundation was in the bathroom at my job haha i had bought it at sephora before work and wasn't wearing makeup that day so i thought, hey, why not. Even without a primer and applied with my fingers with no powder to set, it STILL looked good! If you use a good primer and set it lightly with some powder add some bronzer/blush and BOOM you are fabulous. Seriously, buy this stuff :)Also, i have combination skin.

I have really long (almost to the bottom of my back) curly, thick hair and one bottle is enough.The process is really easy and the directions are clear and understandable.

While walking around with the dye setting, my boyfriend commented I smelled ""like blueberries."" - It's not chemical smelling at all.My hair is medium to dark brown and this makes it slightly darker in areas, but really well lit in other areas. It catches flashes of red, gold, and browns - really making it an interesting color. I always get compliments on it. I also like that it is a 28 day wash out b/c it just fades away over time, instead of making root touch ups and maintenance necessary. It has always lasted in my hair about 6 weeks, though. Perhaps b/c I don't wash my hair everyday, but I've found it really holds up.It leaves your hair REALLY shiny and silky. I have curly, coarse hair and it's usually it's healthiest after I've dyed it with this and used the enclosed conditioner. They give you enough for multiple shampoos, also, which is helpful.The only negative I can think of is that it is impossible to ""rinse until water runs clear.""

I had to get the 14""-24"" size as Pugs are very broad-chested, but having the larger girth means having a longer chest strap. The rear loop that goes around the dog should be just an inch or so behind the front legs; on this one it's much further back. The causes the chest strap to ""bunch up"" when the dog sits, so having all that extra room means the dog gets his front feet through the neck loop quite often.

I love this shea butter version as well as the brazil nut one. You only need to use a really small amount with these body butters as a little goes a surprisingly long way and a tub will last for a really long time. The product is actually so thick that it can take some effort to scoop some out of the container, and I always find it best to warm and soften the butter between my hands to get it to a more workable consistency before applying it to my skin. It's much easier to rub in evenly that way, and will absorb into the skin better.

We bought our Diaper Champ when our first son was born. For pretty much the first year we LOVED it. Everyone is right, you don't have to spend money on seperate bags, it's a nice height so you don't have to bend over it and it's really easy to use. I think it takes about a year though, or maybe even a little longer, and it will start to reek so bad that you'll want to sleep at the neighbors house just to escape the smell. For all of you who haven't used yours long enough-just wait, it will happen. We scrubbed ours with bleach, we emptied it daily, we aired it out in the backyard for two days, and then we finally started putting every single diaper in ziplock bags before putting them in the diaper champ (so much for no extra bags!). NOTHING helped. I'm not stupid, I understand that when it comes to diapers, nothing is smell proof. We emptied it all the time and disinfected it constantly. But I'm not talking normal stinky diaper smell. I'm talking the combined smell of every stinky diaper in the entire world. It was SO BAD. Unless you plan on potty training your child when he turns one, and good luck with that, you'll probably end up replacing yours before the diaper days are over. In the end we bought a Diaper Genie. We've used it for two years now and have had no problems. It kinda stinks a little when you open it, but the smell stays in there when it's closed.

What's more, it is highly recommended throughout Europe and relatively new here.PEEK as you can read from the description, cleans a multitude of surfaces. What you don't read is how incredibly long it lasts and just how much it outperforms other products. For instance, I used PEEK on my gold wedding ring to start with and the thing has never looked so good since the day my husband bought it. Next, I tried what could have been a tougher task in polishing an old copper pot that was close to turning green. Again, PEEK exceeded expectations.In comparison to other products, I no longer need one for silver, one for gold, one for brass, let alone the bunch that are used on laminate surfaces, ceramics, etc.Finally, my husband used PEEK on his boat since the manufacturer claims it can be used on fiberglass and gelcoat. Not only did it restore the fiberglass to a new finish, but it also removed all clouding from the plexiglass and glass!I haven't tried all the uses for PEEK, but I will eventually. So far as a downside, I would say that PEEK isn't recommended for ""fake"" metals like cheap brass. These metals have only a thin paint-like layer of the metal and PEEK may take it off. For these surfaces, however, soap and water should be enough.In conclusion, what makes PEEK such an interesting product is that the manufacturer has taken the time to gain significant endorsements. Things like USDA & NSF approval, passing tests by manufacturers such as Genecos and Wilsonart, and even catering to the Queen of England.When I contacted the manufacturer to learn more about the product (which they are easy to contact peek@peekpolish.com) they shared their latest news that in 2005 they received the British Royal Warrant for their product line allowing them to display the Royal Coat of Arms on future PEEK products.A PEEK product should definitely be in every home.",health personal care,household supplies,household cleaning,342

I drove with him in my lap a couple of times on short trips, but it's unsafe and then he began moving around too much. I've been socializing him and taking him on mini 5 min. trips and he would whine. I thought I would have to let go of my hope of having a dog that can hang out with me until today! He loves it. I put toys in there, a Kong and even though he whines a little it's nothing like before, he even fell asleep. He's a Havanese, 12 week puppy that weights 8 lbs. I bought the medium because I wanted him to have room to lay down and shift around. I am very pleased. I hook his Puppia harness up to the security latch that comes with the car seat. I secure their latch through the seatbelt. Yes, it moves a little from left to right unless you put a safety pin to secure it to the actual seat belt, but I like the movement, it let's him from to shift positions. I think this seat is as safe as one can get. Really, if there was a bad accident we are both in for it.

There's an upgrade of him in the ultra class which was Galaxy Force FirstGunner. There are other upgrades like Hot Shot and Scattorshot. And Leobreaker is the upgrade of Overhaul.

This was my first aquarium filter system and I did my homework to make sure I bought a problem free and effective system for my new red-earred slider and fish friends. I live in Hawaii close to sea-level, so my 100 gal Rubbermaid stock tank is my outside aquarium on blocks under a tree. It's necessary to follow all directions. One of the most important is to keep the filter at the correct level below the water level. I have my tank on 3 rows of cement blocks and still had to dig a hole where my XP3 sits inside a 10 gal bucket. I went overboard with too many fish, but the filter still had no problem keeping all critters healthy and the turtle spends most of his time chasing his girlfiend red koi and basking on an island made out of PVC and coated chicken wire. I only have to change the mechanical filters monthly, and only the micro (white) filters cannot be reused. To keep algae down I added a UV filter. I find that the nitro-zorb, bio-zorb, and phos-zorb packets that Rena makes keep the water very clean. 16 months now and my XP3 is still quiet and efficient. I liked it so much I bought a spare.

Noticed a marked improvement in the height of raised scars (they are much smoother) but no improvements otherwise (in color/size), meaning scars that were not raised already have shown no improvement.Biggest complaint is that they just don't stick well. When you first open a new one, it will probably stick well for about a 12 hours (the recommended amount of time to wear one in a day), as long as you aren't too hairy (and I am, they peel off my arms right away). But you are supposed to be able to re-use them for several days - yet after the first day, they barely stick at all (the directions say to wash them every day with water - I was skeptical at first that this would help, but it actually makes them stick better - just not well enough). Don't even think about wearing them at night without tape - they will peel off and get lost (or stuck in your hair :P ).Overall:The Good:- seem to work well on raised scars- bandages are fairly large, by cutting them up i can cover 3 scars with one bandage- are good for about 5-6 days if you keep taping them downThe Bad- don't stick - whatever you pay for these, expect to pay about that much again in medical tape (i use scotch tape because i am cheap)- haven't helped with the color or size of scars (i don't really care that much, i was just curious if these would work - but for most people, i imagine this is the most important aspect)Final Word:2 stars, until I see more improvement.

Way too expensive to do on a long term basis, at that price it costs more than the entire new power filter after just 3 months. It was my bad though. I used very, very fine sand which got between the impeller shaft and housing and went about grinding between these until there were large grooves in the impeller shaft. This lends to a very noisy pump, so you have to replace. Plus, soon after the grooves begin to show and make noise, they deepen and eventually cause the impeller's blades to catch, pumping stops momentarily. its a noisy, inefficient operation. Unacceptable...so don't use fine sand in a power filter (or maybe just one marketed for only ~$25). You can do things to reduce the effect the suspended sand can have by reducing the amount of time you run the filter when sand is still stirred up. Let it settle before starting the filter up.

The only drawback to this one is they made the metal clip length too short that holds the curler in place so if you have thicker hair they don't want to stay on as well. I saved the longer clips from my previous set and use both of them together. This works perfectly. I would suggest to the company to make their clips about an inch longer and it would fit all hair types.

My first inclination was to buy the 2"" size - that would make the process faster, right? Well, I was advised and found out to be true that bigger is not better in this situation, for reasons stated below. So while I highly recommend the CHI Turbo straightener, I would recommend the smaller widths unless you know for a fact that you prefer the larger plates. The following section is my review for the 0.7"" (which is mistakenly advertised as 0.07""), which I think is helpful even if you decide on the 2"" model, so forgive my copy-and-paste.I was suspect of the need for ""ceramic ions"" and ""far infrared technology"", but this iron was highly recommended by salon personnel, so I decided to dish out the money and try it. You don't need to believe the hype to realize that this is a top quality product. This was a case of ""you get what you pay for""! It is lightweight and ergonomic, heats up almost immediately, has a slider bar for varying heat from 176-356F (80-180C), and velvety felt that protects you from burns (also allows me to get closer to my ears and scalp without getting burned). The latter feature is worth the money to me alone, and the the ceramic feels much gentler to my hair (I have baby fine hair very prone to breakage). Two other things to keep in mind when choosing a straightener:1) size matters - smaller size is better - it's more maneuverable, and doing smaller sections at a time will produce better results.2) not all ceramic is created equal - there are solid ceramic plates or plates COATED with ceramic that are cheaper. the ceramic layer on the coated plates can peel off and is supposedly damaging to your hair (not to mention your product is ruined).So yes, this iron is more expensive, but hopefully it will last for years of top-notch straightening.",beauty,hair care,styling tools,335

Please drain the reservoir of any remaining water or solution after each use, which may be done by letting the flosser run for 7-10 seconds after using the product. This should prevent the unit from leaking while not in use.Sincerely,Katie M.Consumer ServicesService@waterpik.comYes, the reservoir does not leak if it's empty, but the whole reason for a reservoir is to hold water & I love the convenience of not having to fill it every time I use it.Sorry but this will be my last!!",health personal care,personal care,oral hygiene,157

Our local store began carrying the theater boxes at a good price recently and I was excited to have easy access to them. But the pink ones are foul.

The candy coating offers a nice textural contrast to the stiff wheat based licorice of the snap, but no additional flavor. But after two pink snaps, my tongue starts to burn. Candy should not be painful to eat. So any package that I purchase means that I have to immediately sort out the pink. So I'm throwing away 25% of any package I purchase, making them that much more expensive for what I can eat, and making me more reluctant to purchase them. If American Licorice would simply use a different red coloring for the pink, I'd be purchasing these constantly.

It's very soft in my hands, and I have knots all through it at certain lengths so I can step on it and stop my dog, without having the leash slide under my shoe.Also, for long walks in the country, I put a harness on my dog and hook this up to her... she's able to go ahead of me a bit or stop and sniff the flowers while I keep going. Unlike a flexi lead, she doesn't need to be constantly pulling me, so that's not an issue.One thing I really like about this long line is that it is easy to untangle, but once you put a knot in it then that knot's going to be there forever. Something that I'm a little disappointed about in this leash is that if you let it drag on the road AT ALL, there's a little bit of wear on it, especially where knots are... so I'd suggest not letting it drop to the ground if you're walking on the road. In the grass is fine, but not on the road.",pet supplies,dogs,training behavior aids,322

I like the way it is molded to the right shape. And most of it is very open and breathable. Unfortunately, the part that seems to get the most sweaty in any wrist brace is the palm, and this is no exception. One other disadvantage compared to a standard wrist brace is that it is less adjustable. Unlike one with a metal splint, you can't bend the plastic structure of this and reshape it. And the strap that goes between the thumb and index finger (the part that some reviewers report broke, shown at the top right of the picture, facing towards the viewer) I find uncomfortable because it is then and digs into my hand there. I also find the narrow part just below the thumb opening a little uncomfortable, digging in. I ordered a medium, but might return it and try a large. My wrists are thin, but my hand is fairly wide and long. The palm portion is short, and only comes halfway up my palm.

But what were the chances for an exclusively breast fed baby?The first night we tried the Swaddle Me (aka around here as ""the straight jacket"") I was a little skeptical and hoped that it wasn't too tight. She slept 10 hours that night. And every night since then (the last 9 nights) she has slept no fewer than 8 hours. The 4 AM feeding is gone, and I think it's because my little wiggler doesn't wake herself up because she is seriously restricted.The ONLY thing I don't like is that Leah needs the bigger size now and I can't find it in stores.

I've tried a few quick fixes, nothing works for very long. The only real way to keep it from jumping track is to build a ply wood runner under the track, and secure the track to it.

3229,B0002TEC62,Passion Copulin Concentrate,A2YM2NM7YZA24Q,16/23,4.0,1100736000,"The active ingredient in this product are copulins which are odoriferous fatty acids secreted by the woman's vagina when she is in the optimum stage of fertilization and arousal. These copulins attract men and have been scientifically proven to cause a temporary testosterone spike of 150%.Since this product was made for women, one may wonder why a man would want to use it. In theory, copulins let women know on a subconscious level that the man with copulins on him has recently been with a woman and gave her great pleasure. So the man is tried and true and worth competing for. If you are a married man, you shouldn't use this product without telling your wife first. Otherwise, she may suspect that you've been with another woman.PCC comes in a small 5ml roll on bottle and has a weak watermelon/cucumber fragrance.As a male, I haven't had the responses and reactions I expected from women using this alone. Most of the responsses I got from women were not very noticeable or very subtle. It seems to draw womens attention but they seem rather neutral or indifferent to it. A few women however looked like they were undressing me with their eyes, but not consistently.I've noticed reactions in myself when wearing it in that it makes me more assertive, confident and even impatient. I also tended to fantasize a lot more about women when wearing it. My reaction on other men has varied. Some men acted rather silly around me and others more competitive and agressive to down right rude.This is a very good product when used in the right context. I've had very powerful positive reactions from women when I've used this product in conjunction with androstenol (another pheromone product). Some of the competitive effects come out such as women stepping in front of other women to talk to me and they also tend to be more giggly.From my experiences, using PCC alone will not consistently attract women when used by men. Given its effect on me when wearing it and on other men, there is no doubt that it attracts men when worn by women. I wouldn't suggest that any woman go out wearing PCC alone unless she wants men to come on to her strongly. A better use would be for a woman to put the ""spark"" back in her marriage.",beauty,fragrance,women s,393

You must buy the Ventaire nipples only, which my daughter did not like. (We used the Nuk Nipples, They are wonderful!) and the bottom was just more trouble that it was worth. Where your baby is scream because she is hungry the good old plain Gerber bottles are still the best. There is no assembly work needed. Just pour and serve!",baby products,feeding,gift sets,74

Actually this is the only item that works among them. Though I am kind of suspicious about it's inconsistent readings from time to time.I think Braun IRT452 is a much better product, which I bought one for my parents in China.

I don't know if that is necessary, but the pump had sat idle for almost a year, so I thought I'd play it safe.These tubes are exactly the same as the original tubes that came with my pump. They work perfectly and I'll probably order another pair when my third child arrives!

It works great for me & my family. I ordered it from Amazon once..I had no problems. I keep reading people saying it's goopy, etc but Ive never gotten one like that. This stuff pours out great & I love the small bottle. It's such a space saver. Im doing laundry for 7 people in our house and It's worked great on our 5 kids. My daughter has eczema which is why I need to have a free & clear product. It did slow her itching down some so thats always a plus in my book :) Overall Im happy with how the clothes clean up and the value of this product. The price on Amazon has gone up over the past year...I can buy these for around $4.00 at my local Wal Mart.",health personal care,household supplies,laundry,143

He did not seem to be very interested at first but now he enjoys looking at it. Actually both my 2 year old and my 1 year old enjoy the mobile. They only problem I had was attaching the mobile to the crib but I believe it is because the design of the crib is old. I strongly recommend this product for entertaining but not for sleeping.,toys games,baby toddler toys,crib toys attachments,80

When the pharmacy orders it, it comes with ice packs. Why didn't it come with an ice pack? How much bacteria is alive after how many days in transit with the postal service? I even paid extra to have it shipped faster, thinking the ice might not be melted by the time it got here. Thank goodness I ordered the pills and not the yogurt. I'm wondering if any bacteria is even alive by the time it reached me.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,unknown,85

It is still in use, although it is starting to crack in some spots. The steps are hollow, I think if they were solid that would prevent the cracking.

When putting this together we noticed the two front wheels wouldn't turn. We had to bend the frame that holds the petals and front wheels quite a bit to get it to work properly. Once it was all put together, it works well. I wish they would have made all gray and chrome parts either gray or chrome. It looks funny that some parts are chrome and others are gray.We are also making cushions for the bottom and back of the seat so its more comfortable.Overall, I think its adorable and my nephew is going to love it!",toys games,tricycles,scooters wagons,110

36130,B00005BUB0,BABYBJORN Safe Step,A3GQWDBJF71OLC,3/3,2.0,1329609600,"I actually liked this stool for the longest time. What I love about it is the slip-resistant top and bottom. However, as my kids got older and weighed more, I find that if they if they place their weight too much to one side it does tip over. They've learned to be careful and we do still use this in their bathroom. My biggest problem with the stool is that the underside of the stool is made with a plastic grid and once my son fell on it when the stool was upside down and had to go to the hospital and get stitches in his knee. I was surprised that the plastic was able to cut him like that. Now, I know Baby Bjorn did not intend for this stool to be used upside down, but my kids are always moving this stool around to use it in different places, and sometimes they leave it upside down. These are just things to keep in mind if you purchase this stool. I obviously haven't thrown mine out, but I wouldn't buy another one & it probably should have gone into the trash after a visit to the emergency room.",baby products,potty training,step stools,199
