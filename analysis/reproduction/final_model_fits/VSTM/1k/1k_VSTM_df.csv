Once you figure out how all the pieces fit together, it's super easy and quick to assemble. It's manual, so you have to have patience for it to create some pressure. This thing saved my life. At first I wasn't getting pressure, and I was just using it to get my nipple to poke out so that my baby could latch on easily. Then, pressure started to build, and milk was flowing out like a fountain. Once I got the hang of it, it was great. It doesn't hurt, it's small and easy to carry around. The only thing I hated were the 4 oz bottles it came with. They leaked and came with too many pieces (bottle, neck and top). But I don't see those in the picture here, so maybe Avent did away with that. I discovered that regular avent bottles can attach to the pump as well, so that was good.",baby products,feeding,breastfeeding,170,baby products,True

I never ever had a problem training a dog to heal on and off leash until I got a rescued 5 year old Weimaraner. I tried for over three months to get him to walk on a slack leash. I don't believe in letting a dog choke himself by constant pulling. Normally a voice que short tap works just fine because eventually all you need is the voice que. In frustration, decided to use the Gentle Lead as a last resort. The reason was that with a horse if you control the head the rest will follow. So the first thing I did was put the DVD aside and figured out how to put it on my dog because I am just sooo smart. It worked OK he was easier to control but the nose band would go sideways thus messing with his mouth and eyes. On a whim I decided to watch the DVD and discovered that I wasn't smart at all and didn't put it on correctly. Once I did that the dog was almost perfect and after a week of leash training there is no pulling at all and he responds great with voice ques. Never forget some/most dogs think pulling is a game unless they are taught differently. Yes, the collar is thin but it doesn't have to be more than that because there is no problem with pulling once they get they understand what is expected of them and after all it is the owner's responsibility to teach them. I will never use a choke chain again. Control the head and the rest will follow. I read some of the reviews that were negative and they have valid arguments; however remember the goal is a slack leash so when your dog pulls just stop in your tracks until he looks back at you, praise him and walk on. This way he will know what is required of him. Pull and we go no further slack and we move out. It will take some time but hopefully no too much.",pet supplies,dogs,collars,366,pet supplies,True

He started playing with the shapes when he was about 8 months old, at 11 months he still plays with it every day and he is just starting to try to put the shapes into the holes.Here are a few reasons it is one of our favorites:-The shapes are easy to hold and brightly colored, each shape is a shaker with its own pleasant sound. When we listen to music he often shakes and clacks them together to the music.-Both sides come off easily but not too easily. If I take one side off he puts the shapes in and dump them out or with both sides off it is like a tube for rolling around and various other games. If I put all of the shapes in and close both sides he rolls it around and shakes it in both directions. Occasionally a shape will find its way out through its own hole but they dont all come flying out and the sides stay in tact.-The holes are just right, easy enough to fit the shapes so he can have some success and ""get"" the game.If you are looking for a good non-electronic learning toy I highly recommend this one!",toys games,baby toddler toys,shape sorters,243,toys games,True

I was skeptical of course, as someone who tried almost everything, but they do offer a one year money back guarantee, so I tried them. In three weeks, my skin was clear. After six month of using them, I don't break out anymore.The only thing I don't like is that the bottles are really small.

I was immediatly disappointed. Time and time again, the LOUD motor would run and the clumps would either get broken up between the tines before the end of the cycle, or they would fall under the tines on the incline to the recepticle. I found myself scooping pretty much after every time the box was used. Then yesterday, it just stopped working. The yellow light, indicating the air cleaner was active failed to illuminate and after 10 minutes it never ran. Today, I was so frustrated, I got my money back at Petco and got me a ""clevercat"" which has awesome reviews. Yeah I may have to scoop now....but I already feel a weight off my shoulders since that demon box is gone. I feel like I won the lottery since it's out of my house.

Thirteen years later, I finally get my hands on a copy of Blood. I'm blown away to say the least.Blood puts you in the shoes of Caleb, a man who worshipped the evil god Tchernobog, all for the love of a girl. Tchernobog kills you all, and you rise from your grave, pitchfork in hand and quoting ""Army of Darkness"" already (I live...Again!), you are out to massacre the entire cult of Tchernobog, and the leader himself. The game has a pretty hokey story, but what do you expect from a 1990's First Person Shooter? You're playing them for the gameplay, not to hear some epic story the caliber of Mass Effect or Metal Gear Solid.Now, the gameplay. It is once again, typical 90's FPS action, but with a few things that seperates it from games like Duke Nukem 3D or Shadow Warrior. First things first, the blood. Obviously it'll have blood with a name like Blood, but the levels are off the charts here. On the walls, on the ceiling, floors, it is EVERYWHERE. Now I've played Mortal Kombat, Soldier of Fortune, etc, but Blood has some of the most extreme over the top blood/gore/violence I have ever seen in a video game, if not the most. Onto the weapons, they have to be some of the most imaginative, funny, awesome weapons I've ever used in a video game. Heck, the game's flamethrower is a lighter and an aerosol can. Yeah, it's that awesome. Some others that really stand out is the Double Barreled Shotgun, Tommy Gun, Dynamite, Tesla Cannon, and the Voodoo Doll. Also, Blood may be the first video game to introduce secondary fire modes on all weapons. So for example, hit the fire button the the double barreled shotgun, you shoot one shell. Hit the alternative fire button, fire both barrels. It's some really cool stuff.Right now, I am going to dedicate a portion of this review to the level design. It is the best I have ever played. Sure, Doom was cool. Duke Nukem 3D had some great ideas and cool levels. Dark Forces II",toys games,games,board games,365,toys games,True

(I take Citrical Calcium + D in addition to Bluebonnet -- too neurotic to rely on any one brand to protect my bones!) The advantage of this formula is how pleasant and easy the liquid is to take compared to the usual horse pills that calcium comes in -- so while the pill-taking feels like a chore, having a spoon or two of this fruity liquid seems more like a treat, which means you'll be less likely to skip a dose. In the back of my mind, I have a little concern over the lack of a ""USP Verified"" mark, which would give some level of assurance that this Bluebonnet stuff does indeed contain what the label says it does.

I'm not a cologne expert or anything but I have owned a few ""good"" brand named fragrances over the years that I have paid 30 to $50 a bottle for a couple ounces. I must say the bod fragrances rank right up there in my book. A couple sprays and your good all day. Be careful with the large 8 oz. bottles because they have a really wide spray dispersal and you will smell too strong if you don't go easy with it. BOD is potent, but smells good if sprayed moderately (1 or 2 sprays for big bottle 2 or 3 for small bottle). Depending on the person you may have to spray more or less. If you are a regular working guy who wants to smell good and not spend $50 a bottle you can get 5 or 6 bottles of bod for the price of one brand named fragrance.

It adds two types of tiles -- two ""Cathedral"" tiles, which causes a city to be worth 3 times the points if it is finished, or makes a city worth nothing at the end of the game if it isn't finished. It also adds a handful of ""Inn on the lake"" tiles which makes a road worth 2 times the points when finished or worth nothing if unfinished at the end of the game. Finally, a new pawn is included, which is worth two people when determining ownership of completed sections.There are two disadvantages with this set -- the backs are slightly different than the original set, which I didn't originally notice. It's not too bad, but it was bad enough for the hardcore players that a bag is given in a later expansion set to solve this problem.

I give it 5 stars educational value, because all puppet/plush can be educational depending on how you use them. I can't give it full credit for durability, though because it is somewhat delicate, and you most definitly can not toss it in the washer. You can still sleep with it, use it as a pillow, cuddle it, as long as you don't try ripping the eyes out or seeing if it will stand up to a real Great Horned Owl.

Now, supposedly this warmer can be used with Dr. Brown's bottles but the combination didn't work for us. First of all, the bottle has to be positioned in the warmer a certain way so that it presses a safety latch to keep the warmer on.

I had to sit there and continuously push the bottle down onto the latch AND then after 10 minutes, the bottle was still ice cold!

This review is based off of people who own the doll and their videos. The first point is the doll is fun for most kids that are over six. If the kid is younger than six, they may have a lot of trouble using this doll. The functions require the expertise of an older child. Most kids think the doll is a lot of fun to feed and give a bottle but hate changing the diaper. It really is digusting. Green goop eww! Maybe Hasbro should make the doll waste look a little less nasty. Most kids are two disgusted to play with the doll until it is clean. I would suggest only giving the doll water since this will prevent the disgusto green goop. The food is nasty. AVOID IT! The good thing about baby alive is that it does not wake up to noise when it is sleeping. It only asks for stuff and makes noise when you press the bracelet, so if you want it to be quiet already all you have to do is NOT press the button! I have also heard this doll attracts dirt, so you might want to find a nice clean shelf for it. It is important to flush the doll out with its bottle every now and then to keep it clean or else it will grow mold. This happened to my baby born doll and it is disgusting. As you can see if you can handle some easy maitnence and have a mature kid that knows how to use the doll you can have a lot of fun with baby alive. Before buying it be sure to read the other reviews on here both positive and negative and watch some videos of the doll on youtube.com. Trust me, you want to be informed. Don't say I didn't warn you:) More reviews coming from me soon.

I've done everything I can think of to not waste my investment in this product. Nothing contains the odors it started to let out after about the 5th month. I phoned the Diaper Champ customer service to ask what to do about the smell, the girl on the line told me the smell is normal as about every 6 months the seals on the unit need to be replaced. Nowhere in the instructions I received did it say that this would be necessary. Furthermore, DC Customer Service said that I'd have to phone in every 6 months to have them send out my free replacement kit to maintain my unit. Incorrectly wrapping your diapers before putting them in the unit can hasten this process as a loose tape can wreak havoc with the foam seals.

Now, I'm returning it.It was intended for a young child who is already familiar with letters and numbers, but not yet at reading and math. He loves using a keyboard just like his parents do. I'd talked myself into the small screen and I regret it. I'd hoped a small screen would mean that at least what they displayed was a decent resolution. But these visuals are about what you'd expect from a digital watch earned through cereal boxtops. In addition, the 31 activities are all highly guided and very limited, with unpleasant noises anytime a wrong selection is made. There are a few activities that approached 'fun' by emulating more popular, known-to-be-fun games, but for the most part it's dull single-answer quiz questions, where correct answers are rewarded by an awful, nearly-incomprehensible animation of a dancing squirrel.All it would have taken for me to approve of this product was a segment where my child could type random letters in and be told what they were, or experiment with typing words of his own choosing, or choose a number and have that number of items appear. Those modes do not exist; everything present save the tacked on music mode requires the child to respond to the toy's demands rather than the toy respond to the child's. Thus, the interactivity of the toy is very, very small. Of course, even if those modes did exist, the toy would have been hard-pressed to compete with a bland text editor on a basic computer because of how hard it was to see what was supposed to happen on the screen.",toys games,electronics for kids,electronic toys,286,toys games,True

365,25863,B00016X1VS,Crystal Body Deodorant Crystal Body Deodorant Stick,A1HAE81PLVGK2Y,5/5,4.0,1289433600,"I really like the Crystal products. About 5 years ago, for some reason, traditional deodorants started making me itch immensely. I tried hypoallergenic brands, sensitive skin brands, ""natural"" brands, etc, and everything made me itch so bad. Then I heard from my aunt about some ""rock"" a friend of hers used that worked great. So I finally purchased the Crystal ""rock"" (without any holder or anything). At first, I wasn't impressed , probably because I was so used to the strong smelling traditional deodorants - I could smell some stinkyness with the Crystal. So I started to go without using any type of deodorant, which really sucks. We are sure smelly creatures! I was so self conscious; I hated reaching around people because I could smell myself and I was worried they would smell me too. After going like this awhile, I couldn't even get the smell off in the shower, I could soak in the tub and scrub with soap, and when getting out of the shower my pits would still stink. So that's when I decided to try the Crystal ""rock"" again, and it definitely works! It is not flawless protection, as you can tell since I wasn't impressed going from traditional pit stick to this, but after going a year without wearing anything and stinking to high hell, this Crystal does work. I have now used all forms of Crystal. The Rock is great, it will last you way over a year, probably even 2 years. However one day I accidentally dropped it in the sink and it broke into a bunch of pieces; the biggest remaining piece had some sharp edges so I needed to buy a new one. So I bought The Rock in the plastic holder, and that is definitely nicer. However one time on a flight it must have gotten whacked because the deal that pushes the deodorant up stopped working. Then I tried the Roll On Crystal. I would say that is my favorite form, however you will go through it a lot faster. A bottle would last me maybe 2 months. I really liked it though, just a couple swipes and I was good to go. When I ran out of that I decided to buy the Spray bottle since it is a lot cheaper per ounce, thinking I would use it to refill my roll on bottle; however I could not get the roll on bottle open so I am forced to using it as a spray. Several reviewers say they can use just 2 sprays, however I am up to 12 sprays per pit just to get decent coverage so the bottle doesn't last long either. So overall, if you have skin sensitivities to traditional pit stick like me, or you worry about the chemicals in traditional deodorant, I would definitely recommend Crystal. If you want to save money, I would splurge for getting the Rock in the plastic holder because the rock will break if you drop it - you have to wet the rock before using it which makes it slippery, so the plastic holder is great to keep your fingers dry and prevent you from dropping it; if you don't mind the price and want the liquid, I would recommend the Roll On.",health personal care,personal care,deodorants antiperspirants,547,beauty,False

Not moving at all, getting up to even crawl to the bathroom was nearly impossible, so I'd eat and drink as little as possible.Last week, I started feeling that familiar sharp twinge in my lower to mid back and started to worry that it was about to go out.I'm an ICU nurse, so I work 12-14 hour shifts without stopping, rolling very heavy sedated patients several times a night.

I think this might not work for people who are very heavy or have a big musculature, but I'm small/tall enough that this thing fits me well, and I don't exert too much downward force on my own frame.I also have no butt (sadly, I'm working on it)so I have to bend my knees and plant my feet on the ground to elevate my backside a bit. This with the pillow under my head as recommended by the instructions, and a little minor adjusting up and down to find the right part of the curve, and INSTANTLY I felt a stretching and heard a few pops that felt amazing and relieving.After only about 10 minutes on the thing I stood up and felt half my age.

Yet for far too many years this vital mineral has been largely overlooked by most doctors. Shockingly, most laboratory blood tests do not even measure magnesium status although magnesium is involved as an essential factor in more aspects of health than any other mineral. Since magnesium status is rarely measured, most doctors don't know when their patients are deficient in magnesium, even though about 80% of Americans are deficient in this essential mineral. And magnesium deficiency is a significant factor -- often the primary factor -- in many severe illnesses including heart attacks and other forms of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anxiety and panic attacks, depression, fatigue, migraines and other headaches, osteoporosis, insomnia, and most cases of muscular problems. Because magnesium deficiency is largely overlooked, millions of Americans suffer needlessly from the foregoing ailments or are having their symptoms treated with expensive drugs (which often have unpleasant or dangerous side effects) when they could be cured with magnesium supplementation. Anyone interested in learning more about the role of magnesium in human health should acquire and read The Magnesium Miracle by Dr. Carolyn Dean -- available from Amazon.com.The form of magnesium which is best assimilated is chelated magnesium such as this.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,210,grocery gourmet food,False

My feeling is if it doesn't do anything for you why take it???Here's why I changed my mind and decided to try magnesium:One day I just happened to be watching TV and saw this doctor by the name of Carolyn Dean, M.D. ND on a show called 'Your Health' talking about the many benefits of taking magnesium.Many health problems such as insomnia, diabetes, asthma, to migraines to heart disease, etc. can be treated with magnesium. One of the major benefits is it relaxes your muscles. I was intrigued, it almost sounded too good to be true.Long story short, I started taking magnesium taurate (by Cardiovascular Research) about 3 weeks ago and used it for my on and off insomnia that I had been having for the past two years. Not having high expectations (because of my past experiences) I wasn't expecting much. Boy was I wrong! The first night I took it I fell into a deep sleep, like 1-2-3, and woke up extremely refreshed. I couldn't believe it. 3 weeks later I can still fall asleep right after taking the pill, it isn't a fluke.

I felt encouraged after reading the reviews on this line of products.I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, serum and hair spray.Upon arrival, I used the hair spray. I saw no difference in my thinning hair. A few days later, I decided to wash my hair and try the other products. My expectations were low, after seeing no results from the hairspray. Boy! Was I surprised.After shampooing, conditioning, and using the serum, my hair felt thicker. It was also smooth, soft and shiny. I couldn't believe it. After allowing my hair to air dry, I applied DermMatch to the thinning areas in the crown. I combed the DermMatch through my hair until my hair was completely dry. Using a paddle brush, I brushed my hair thoroughly to remove any excess DermMatch. I then flat ironed my hair. I finished with the hairspray. My hair looked amazing. It looked like I had just stepped out of a salon. It was so full, shiny and healthy looking. I then applied a small amount of Enjoy smooth and shine to add more sheen. Although my hair felt a little stiff from the spray, it really wasn't. My paddle brush and comb ran easily through my hair.Before bedtime, I put a few of the foam rollers that are wrapped with satin in the crown area. When I removed them the next morning, I could not believe how my hair had curled. My hair is normally hard to curl even when I use setting lotion. I had rolled my hair dry and got curl and body. I brushed out the curl, added a little more Enjoy smooth and shine and the hairspray. Voila! I couldn't believe the results. It looked as if I had grown more hair overnight.This line of products seem to work in synergy. So, results are best when shampoo, conditioner, serum and hairspray are used together.I love that the products have little to no scent.

And that's just off the top of my head. Chimney is an open design (hollow) to allow Santa, monsters, pyromaniacs, or chimney sweeps access to the fireplace and the rest of the abode. The specific problem that I want to mention here is just what some others have complained about- the hinges and the hook and knob closures constantly fall off. These parts do snap back in quite easily. I know that Playmobil stands apart with their totally plastic products; I wish that they would consider adding metal rods and screws into the design of these take-along dollhouses in the future. Imagine walking cheerfully along, hummin' a tune, with the loaded dollhouse in hand, only to have it burst open and spew its entire contents into non-recently mowed grass. We (well, actually just me) have learned to live with it by policing its loose aforementioned parts, but who the heck wants to do that? The whole point of this house is ""grab-n-go"", so please, Playmobil, make this ideal of mine a reality for future owners of this dollhouse.",toys games,action toy figures,playsets,271,toys games,True

It is annoying, uncomfortable, and downright dangerous, because my knee would collapse without warning. My balance and gait were getting increasingly unsteady. At age 60, I can't afford to be falling because of a ""trick"" knee. It took me about a year to figure out what was causing my knee to hurt constantly and collapse. Not only did my knee hurt, it made my entire leg hurt, from my foot all the way up the leg. It just ached on many days. I finally figured out that it was the patella not staying in place, and a chiropracter recommended a strap under the knee to solve the problem. I looked at a number of different straps, and settled on this one, because unlike most of the others, I did not have to try to figure out if I needed a small, medium or large. The velcro on this one allows it to be adjusted for a wide range of sizes, and to fit snugly enough to do the job, but not too tight. It is reasonably priced compared to others. I have not had one wear out in several months of using it on a daily basis, although I bought two, just in case. I have not had to use the second one I bought. And it does in fact solve the problem.

You only get 12oz of Slurpee per batch, and you'll be lucky to get three batches done before the entire center ice assembly has warmed too much to be useful and needs to be refilled to make more.In the right hands, the Slurpee Maker can be a great toy to use occasionally, but I'm left feeling that anyone who can actually operate the product successfully is unlikely to be satisfied with how much you get out of it relative to the time investment in using it.",toys games,dress up pretend play,pretend play,250,health personal care,False

I used to sell high-end supplements when I was 18, and I quit the ""top"" company as soon as I learned about Life Force. Life Force is rated top five in the supposedly neutral Comparative Guide to Nutritional Supplements, although I believe the rating was skewed towards that company I used to work for. In either case, Life Force was just as good as the number one supplement I used to sell, and it was one-third the cost. This is by far the highest quality, lowest price multi-vitamin in the world, and you owe it to yourself to take this above any other supplements.I follow ABC bodybuilding's article on the Window of Opportunity.Please keep in mind that it is a guide, not a dogma. Do what feels right and what works for you.The Window of Opportunity is a post-workout shake that I used when I put on over 30 pounds of muscle within 3 months. My bench went from 215 pounds to 450, body fat from 7% to 3%, and mile time from 6 minutes to 5. It works.Here are the quick basics, although you definitely must read the article yourself.After the work out, you should consume .22 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight and 5 grams of carbohydrate (half dextrose, half maltodextrin) per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for bulking, or 2.5 grams of carbohydrate (half dextrose, half maltodextrin) per 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for cutting.You should also consume 5-10 grams of creatine, 5-10 grams of glutamine, and a multi-anti-oxidant formula. All this must be done over a 45-60 minute period.The 45-60 minute sequence is vital:Step One:* Blend 1/3 protein (experiment to find the exact number for you), 1/3 dextrose (simple sugar), and 1/3 maltodextrin (complex sugar) with enough water (water should be at least 92% of the total mixture). Add 500 mg of sodium per liter of water used.* Shake the ingredients well. Put creatine powder in your mouth (5-10 grams when starting, 2.5-5 grams once body is saturated with creatine) and drink the shake to wash the creatine down. It is better to do this than to mix the creatine in water, as that makes creatine lose its potency.* Drink one half of the shake within 5 minutes of working out. After this 5 minutes, allow an additional 10-15 minutes for the solution to settle in your stomach.Step 2:* After the solution has dissolved in your stomach for 10-15 minutes, consume 5-10 grams of Glutamine and your multi-vitamin (Life Force) with one gulp of the shake.* Continue to drink the remaining half of the shake for the following 30-45 minute period.* It is vital to drink small sips of your shake for the entire 30-45 minute period. This allows for maximum absorption rate of the nutrients into your body.Step 3:* Take fish oil with a meal, preferably at breakfast.* Take ZMA on an empty stomach, 30 minutes before you go to sleep.",health personal care,nutrition wellness,vitamins supplements,503,grocery gourmet food,False

I'd seen it advertised, and it struck me as just another toy to play annoying songs. I actually try to avoid battery-powered toys as much as possible. However, I wanted a toy that my 10 month old son could play with in the kitchen while I cook/clean/etc.The stage came today, and as is written in the amazon description/editorial off the toy, the legs are a pain to put on, mainly because I couldn't get the screws to go all the way in. I am satisfied, however, that they are in good enough for the toy to be sturdy and not a hazard of any sort.After I put the toy together, I let my son have a go at it, and oh my gosh, he was in heaven. The voice that scat sings is the voice of a child, and while it isn't necessarily music to my ears, my little boy laughed his head off. He loves the mirror and the lights. He loves the music. He preferred the mode where he can hit and make the sounds rather than the songs just playing for him. And that was fine by me because I was able to clean the kitchen up while he laughed and played. I even stopped what I was doing to grab the video camera because he was having such a big time. Even more importantly, I put him down late for his nap because he was having such a big time. Trust me, I am schedule-bound, so a late nap is huge.The only critique I have of the toy (other than the previously mentioned leg attachment issue) is that I wish the feet had some sort of non-sliding surface. We have linoleum in our kitchen, and the stage kept sliding away from him. I put it against the wall/cabinets, and that helped. I'll attach some non-slip stuff of some sort to the feet, but it would be nice if Fisher Price would do this as well. More and more people seem to have hardwood floors, so I would think it would be beneficial to many.If I had it to do over again, I would definitely buy this toy again. It really was one of the biggest hits I've gotten him, and believe me, I've put some money into toys over the past few months.

I came across this product and read a couple of reviews and decided to purchase it. After moving from Austin, TX (dry climate) to Baton Rouge, LA (very humid) my skin went crazy. I had some breakouts that were stubborn and hard to treat. I bought this product because I have oily, blemish prone skin. After the first two or three applications my skin started to improve drastically, let's also take into account that my skin had started to improve on its own given the fact that I had been here for a couple months. It does an EXCELLENT job treating acne before it actually occurs. If you feel sore spots on your skin but there is no raised bump yet, this is perfect for that cause they'll never actually erupt into a breakout if treated with Bye Bye Blemish. Even though I have oily skin I ONLY use it once a day and at night. It can cause excessive drying but I have FOLLOWED the directions so I have not had this problem. It has faded my blemishes also, but I believe that its strength lies in treating acne. It can prevent breakouts and with proper moisturization your skin can heal and you can prevent blemishes from occurring. Also, I do not use the product everyday because it can cause extra drying when used properly. I use an oil free moisturizer daily and sometimes I will give my skin a day off so that it can heal on its own between treatments. Some reviews discussed how the product smells. It's not bad at all. The most important aspect of it all is that it actually WORKS. All you need to do is follow the directions and create a reasonable regimen that works for your skin.",beauty,skin care,unknown,313,beauty,True

But not me - I hate that laborious, time-consuming part of cooking. I use the Quick Chef several times a week and it saves me lots of time, besides avoiding the burning tears from raw onions. Just throw in some chunks of onion, bell pepper, celery, etc., and within seconds of turning the handle you can cut everything to whatever size you need, even finely-diced. The booklet tells you basically nothing (just a few recipes), so you'll need to experiment a little. It probably wouldn't work well for potatoes or raw squash, but it's ideal for softer or watery foods...i.e., onions, bell peppers, celery, tomatoes, hard-cooked eggs, cabbage, avocado, parsley and more. I'm sure I'll continue to find more uses for it.Cleaning this thing is a breeze if you rinse it immediately after use - it's effortless. I've never had to put it in the dishwasher.

I didnt know push brooms could do such a good job. I know how much work its taken to sweep out the garage in the past. I was finished so soon I kept looking around to see what it missed and it hadnt missed a thing. Sure there was a little here and there but there is always that kind of thing with a broom. When I sweep my kitchen floor with a regular broom there can be little things it misses. This actually did a better job then the brooms I use for inside my house. If you have a lot of small spaces to sweep this will not be a good option. You know that up front thou because its 24-inches wide. It made the job of sweeping out the garage so easy. I could have used the leaf blower to clear out the debri but generally what u get when u do that is alot of stuff flying around and the dirt and dust just end up back on the floor. Its alittle tough to say alot of great things about a broom.Simply put,health personal care,household supplies,cleaning tools,242,health personal care,True

The pillow has a wonderful scent, and what is great about it, is that it has a zipper where you can actually either add more filling (I added some lavender seeds that I had for extra fragrence, although it had plenty to begin with!) and you can also remove filling and wash the fabric. The satin side is my favorite, nice and cool on the eyes, while the velvet side is warmer and more cozy. The pillow has plenty of weight to it, so it sits nicely on your face and is big enough to block out the light completely.

The play style is similar to Trivial Pursuit, in that you earn colored stones for answering questions in specific categories, but there are several differences, including the type of questions. The questions are very cool - visual puzzles, anagrams, even math puzzles where they don't tell you the numbers, they just give you hints. Another difference is that you can challenge other players and ""steal"" their stones.There are a few minor problems with the game though, relatively easy to ignore or fix. A couple of the questions (just a couple!) relate specifically to the online game that inspired this, so if you've never played that, you won't know what they are talking about. Easy fix - ignore these questions! Second, the playing pieces are 4 boring cubes in rather unappealing colors that were sometimes hard to tell apart. I simply replaced them with miniature Star Wars figurines and/or the figurines from the game Hero Scape.

The bassinet does lock so it will not tilt if your little one rolls over (mine started to roll to her side at one week). If your baby can roll all the way around it is time to put him or her in a crib! I didn't even bother with the music since musical attachments that come with most baby products sound horrible anyway so I cannot comment on that aspect of the product.

The main piece is the grave with reaper statue, and it features fitted stands to hold the Harry and Voldemort figures. Both figures are impeccably detailed. Maybe too detailed in Voldemort's case, as he is apparently ""going commando"" under his billowing robe. Their wands are tiny, sharp and will probably need to be glued on at some point.There's virtually no playability to this set (much to my son's disappointment), but it makes an amazing display piece for a shelf or desk, and would probably look just as impressive left in the box.

We assumed it was to hold the puzzle pieces in place, but I was concerned that if we removed the plastic film, and did not complete the part of the puzzle that would sit on top of the sticky strips before we rolled it up, then surely the lint from the mat rolling onto itself would get all over the sticky strips and render them useless anyway?Sure enough, when we rolled up the puzzle put it away, the puzzle broke inside the mat.

Almost bought a Braun last xmas but I'm too cheap.So, I'd say that I learned a few things with this razor:1. Read the manual to figure out what that little switch on the side does.2. Always either wash your face or have a wet rag nearby to avoid having a dry face- that makes shaving terrible even with this razor. Lectric Shave is also great stuff but I wish that they had something that did what Lectric Shave did without alcohol. Don't like dry skin.3. You'll probably have to find the position and direction on your face that works for taking off the hair. My hair runs several directions in some cases.4. Go over the spots you just did and make sure you got it all. Not much is more aggrivating than having stubble on a few spots but clear everywhere else.5. Stick with it!!!! It took me about 3 weeks to start to get used to the razor and it makes a big difference in terms of mess, time, etc. by using the electric as opposed to the blade.6. No matter what anyone says, I don't believe that anything shaves as close as a sharp blade.That's it! Enjoy!",health personal care,personal care,shaving hair removal,288,health personal care,True

I called the manufacturer and they shipped a new car to me. New one didn't fit. The manufacturer said it would send new track if the new car didn't fit. But I gave up before exercising that option because I had also received a replacement set from Amazon due to one of the gears being defective. The car/rollercoaster in that set had the same problem.

I tried not to get too excited because i have tried Trimspa and Zantrex before but had very slow results if any.Lipovarin started out ok as i got a little uneasy feeling for the first couple of days but than that went away. I really liked how i got energy from taking the pills in the morning before my workouts and again in the afternoon. I found myself drinking less and less coffee which also helped me save some pocket money! :) My dieting was good as i ate less carbs also. I lost over 4 lbs the first week and was super excited.The next week I felt like i was really sweating more during my workouts and that was surprising to me since i didnt increase anything i was doing in the gym. LIpovarin also seemed to curb my appetite and i didnt have the urge to snack during the day which also helped me since i was a big carb snacker at work. The second week I lost another 3 lbs which i was still very pleased about. I also started to notice a slight chang ein my waist area. It seemed to me that my jeans were fitting better too. My husband also noticed this as well.The 3rd week I lost another 3lbs and although i wanted to keep losing more weight each week i was very happy to maintain what i was doing. My workouts were going very well and i was following my diet very well at this point. The fourth week I slipped a little because of Thanksgiving and I ate more than i wanted to but you all know what happens when the family gets together and everything looks so GOOD to eat! Well i only lost one pound that week but i think it was all due to Turkey day.The 5th week (i was on my second bottle at this point) I really started to see some better increase in the weight loss as I lost 6lbs that week alone! I picked up the cardio a little in the gym because i was upset that i let myself go on thanksgiving and it really showed. Lipovarin was giving me good energy throughout the day and i couldnt be doing what i was doing without it. I actually looked forward to going to the gym and the best part was feeling energized on my way there. I used to dread going to the gym without and energy and just hoping a morning cup of coffee was going to get me going. The diet was back on track and i was eating a stedy flow of chicken salads, tuna, and chicken sandwiches and trying to stay away from late nights eating and drinking lots of fluids.The 6th week I dropped 5 lbs and there was a noticable difference in my body and all my friends and co-workers really started to notice as the compliments were flowing in. This is the best part of dieting and really makes you feel good when compliments are being thrown at you. At this point I have lost over 23 lbs and was well on my way to my goal of 40lbs lost. I was fearful of hitting a plateau and didnt want to do that so i tried a new diet plan which consisted of new foods and it seemed to spark my weight loss more! I added in a protein shake and that helped to increase my protein intake.The next week I lost another 5lbs and actually measured my waist to my surprise i had lost over 3 inches on my waist!! I was so excited to be able to fit into some of my older jeans. I tell you that the best feeling is to look into the mirror and just be able to stare and wonder who that new perons is standing in front of you. I was almost at my goal and was so crazy to get there. I was going to stop at nothing till i reached it. The following week I hit a personal best and lost 7lbs that week! I so focused in the gym and i looked forward to every workout. I added in an extra 30 min on the stair master after my normal hour of treadmill. This was actaully very easy to do as i was in good cardio shape now. I was almost at my goal and was getting very excited and i was going to reach my holiday goal of 40 lbs lost. The next week I only lost 2lbs but it was still positive so i was not complaining (upset but you know the deal). I was almost there but the holidays were right around the corner. I sucked it up and kept myself focused and mid-week i weighed in and had reached my 40lb lost goal! I couldnt believe myself and my hubby was soooo proud of me. At this point 3 of my friends are now on Lipovarin and 2 of my male co-workers so this stuff is great.

900,25776,B0009XQUES,Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit Cuff,AW3QYMTY9QG5O,1/1,5.0,1289001600,"Omron HEM-780 Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with ComFit CuffWithin the past year, after a doctor's visit found me in reasonably good health, I decided to stay on top of my own health, and work towards actually improving it. I started an exercise routine, including a lot of walking.Since doing this, I have started using some different Omron products, including anOmron HJ-112 Digital Pocket PedometerandOmron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor. My blood pressure has not really been an issue. It was a little toward the high side of normal, but nothing to immediately worry about. My doctor told me I needed to lose weight and that would take care of keeping it down. So, in the past year I've gone from 245 to 185 lbs.And, I've finally decided to get a blood pressure monitor. As I've been very satisfied with my other Omron products, and based on the reviews, I decided on this monitor. Now, I've only had it for two weeks, but thus far, I have been very pleased with it. It is very easy to use, and the Comfit Cuff really does make it easy. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how to program the date and time into it, or to change the TruRead mode (takes an average of three readings) or the Single mode.I also like that it reads and records for two users and reads for a guest user. This way, both my girlfriend and I can read and maintain our own records. And, if for some reason, someone was visiting and wanted, or needed, to check their BP, they could do so without influencing our recordings.The ability to give you averages of morning and evening readings is also nice. So far, for me, no issues of ""morning hypertension"", and that is a nice feature.I also like that it runs on batteries or with the AC adaptor, so if you need to take it with you, you know that with good batteries, you need not worry about taking the adaptor (although it fits just fine in the included case, so why not).My big concern, though, was whether this unit was accurate. Out of the box, I guess there really is no way of knowing. As it turns out, I had a doctor's appointment last week; about a week after getting it, and keeping a daily record for a week. And, needless to say, they took my blood pressure at the office. Well, that certainly alleviated my concerns as the readings were very much in line with each other.When I ordered mine, Amazon was offering a $10 off special. My Mom had indicated she wanted an automatic BP monitor, as she has a manual one and finds it rather difficult to use. And actually, although I was planning on buying one for myself anyhow, I was going to order this one for her. Well, with the discount, I ordered two. And here was another big concern of mine - Mom is elderly and small. Would this unit work for her? As it turns out, yes it does. I was afraid the Comfit Cuff might be too big and not work with her, but she has used it, and it works fine. She is probably on the very small end of the spectrum for the Cuff, but it does give good readings for her, and she received no Error messages.Based on my experiences, I would certainly recommend this unit. The only thing I don't know is how long lasting it is, but I'm assuming it will be around for a good while since it is warranted for five years.",health personal care,medical supplies equipment,health monitors,603,health personal care,True

It inflated quickly! The slide comes with two weight bags that you fill with water and clip on to the slide. It makes the slide stable. Be sure to clip them to the slide first, then fill them with water. One of the three clips on one of my bags broke. Oh well. The kids used it & LOVED IT!!!! They got lots of exercise and had a blast! Today is second day that we have used it. A clip on the other weight bag broke, and this time, for no apparent reason. ALSO, when I hooked up the hose to the tube where the water goes, it popped!

Basically you crash the front of the ship into something solid, two panels pop off, and the front end crumples just like a real crash. Neat effect, but it is accomplished through the use of a rubber front end. The two large protrusions on the front of the ship are made out of rubber. This makes them look wavy and out of place compared to the rest of the plastic ship. Is it too much to ask for a simple scale-relica with no gimmicks? For kids this seems to be a great toy and a lot of fun, but for older people seeking more realism it leaves something to be desired.

After i received it, I returned it a day later. I have a couple peg strollers that I am pretty happy with so I thought I'd get the car seat for compatibility. As far as pros go, the fabric on this is gorgeous and the overall appearance is very contemporary. The strap height is very easy to adjust and the strap length appears to have plenty of room for growth. It is a bit heavy but that is to be expected for a seat with the 30 lb weight limit. As for the cons, it's supposedly highly rated for safety due to the extended side protectors around the head. These side impact protectors, that have a long flap that extends all the way down the back of the seat is not removable so my 3 month old son, who is in the 90th percentile for wt/ht, looked bunched up and uncomfortable. They would be great for when he is very young, but when he gets bigger and older, I don't see him tolerating these big ""wings"" on either side of his head that look like horse blinders. Also, I can just see how hot and stuffy they would become this summer. They seem to take up so much room in the seat and would probably make things a bit cramped as he grew. The pictures of this seat make it appear there is a lot of room in between those ""wings"" but when I put my son it the seat, the sides of his head nearly touched them both. The back of the seat didn't have much padding as it was only covered by that black flap (refer to the picture of this seat above) which isn't that thick. I lifted it up to see if it was removable and realized that it was all there was between hard plastic and my son's back. The buckle was a bit tricky to do but I think with practice, it would be manageable (as with our britax roundabout buckle). And these car seats do not even come with the winter boots anymore. I really wanted to like this car seat but couldn't find anything about this seat that makes it at least $100 more than other car seats rated to 30 lbs. There are other safe car seats on the market that are much less expensive.

973,13286,B000A1CLVA,"Britax Regent Youth Car Seat, Onyx",A3G53TPP4HRSG0,3/3,5.0,1206835200,"We used a Peg Perego infant seat for the first year. We loved it, but after 11 months our son started getting a bit cranky. He was ready to face forward in a bigger seat. We didn't mind spending the extra money given the good safety reviews, but we wanted to make sure we'd get to use the seat as long as possible. As many of the other reviewers have noted, the Regent is one of the few (perhaps only) seat out there that goes up to 80 lbs. All the others cap out at 65 lbs.The seat is large (takes up one seat and half the middle seat), but we regularly take long trips to visit family and it's definitely worth it. If you're putting your little one in the seat right after their first birthday, you may want to consider using a head support for sleeping. We just reused the one we had used in his infant seat when he was first born.The install is easy if you follow the directions, but the seat is not one I would recommend moving from car to car on a daily basis. We tried it out for the past three months and are now buying our second seat for convenience as we take turns making the daycare runs.Our only complaint is that the straps get slightly tangled at the hips from time to time and need to be readjusted. Other than that, the straps stay in place and go on and off easily. The strap pads stay on better than they do on the Peg Perego.All in all - worth the money and the peace of mind!",baby products,car seats accessories,car seats,276,baby products,True

I have used some other bottle warmers at friends' houses but I like this one the best so far. Originally I wanted the avent IQ, but since you have to close the top, only my avent bottles would fit in that warmer. I have avent, Dr. browns, and playtex ventaire both standard and wide! So I needed a versatile warmer and this one is just that! All my bottles fit. The only thing I don't like about this product is filling the water cups and dumping them in, the avent fills for you... I noticed there is a version of this bottle warmer without the cooler that fills for you. But as far as a gift goes, I am very happy with this one. I just fill both cups and leave them hooked on the warmer to use later. You do have to read the chart and make sure you are putting in the right amount of water according to the bottle and volume of milk you are warming. Its not very difficult to figure out since the chart is also printed right on the side of the warmer. I really wish I had this during those middle of the night feedings when my baby was still sleeping in my room!! I don't really need the cooler now that my baby is 6 months old.

I increased my dosage to 2 and 1/2 tsp every 3 hours (5 grams) and within about an hour of taking my first dose the pain and urgency was gone.
